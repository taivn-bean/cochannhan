  "content": "Chapter 549: Subduing azure wolves with the help of snow bats\n\nJust like this, Fang Yuan flew for another three days, but could not see even a glimpse of the sacred palace on the plains.\n\nFang Yuan thought to himself: “It seems that I was transported very far away after entering Imperial Court blessed land. Otherwise with my speed, I would’ve reached the sacred palace within three days.”\n\nOn the way, Fang Yuan met many Gu Masters and mortals.\n\nThey were Hei tribe alliance members, after entering the blessed land, those with ability would gather at the sacred palace. Those who did not would choose a place and settle down.\n\nImperial Court blessed land was not safe, there were large numbers of wild Gu worms and vicious beasts.\n\nHei tribe army came here and destroyed their order, disturbing the beasts and worms which had already sorted out their territory.\n\nThus, conflict and killing was natural.\n\nBut all in all, the environment was infinitely better than the outside world, which was face a fierce blizzard.\n\nFang Yuan had seen several slaughtering scenes along the way. Some were beast group corpses, some were humans with broken limbs.\n\nImperial Court blessed land had much greater foundation than Hu Immortal blessed land. There was no weather changes in Hu Immortal blessed land, but Imperial Court blessed land had it.\n\nIn fact, Imperial Court blessed land had morning and night!\n\nThis might not be spectacular in mortal eyes, because in northern plains, there was also day and night, they were used to it.\n\nOnly someone like Fang Yuan would understand the true value of this.\n\nIt was very rare for blessed land to have weather changes. If there was day and night, it meant that this particular heaven and earth had sufficiently deep foundations, at least, the time path law here was quite complete.\n\nNormally, blessed land with astronomical phenomenon were first rate blessed lands. Fang Yuan’s Hu Immortal blessed land had not reached this level yet.\n\nDay and night was the characteristic of grotto-heavens.\n\nBlessed lands were small worlds. Above blessed lands, there were even more complete and refined small worlds, they were grotto-heavens.\n\nImperial Court blessed land already had the characteristics of a grotto-heaven, it could be said to be a quasi grotto-heaven. Lang Ya blessed land was originally a grotto-heaven that fell, by now, it had lost its day and night trait.\n\nNight descended.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the sky, it turned from a glorious gold color to a light and elegant silver.\n\nThe daytime in Imperial Court blessed land was a dazzling golden day. At night, it was not completely dark, as silver light shine in the sky.\n\nFlying in the air, Fang Yuan witnessed the changing of the sky.\n\nSilver light rained down, compared to the hot and dazzling golden rays during daytime, it had traces of sharpness to it.\n\nFang Yuan’s flying speed was slowing down, he looked down and after searching for a while, he found a gentle slope.\n\nWith his years of experience, he knew that the gentle slope was a great place to set up camp.\n\nBut he was in no hurry to descend, he circled around the slope several times, like a bird flying freely.\n\nEventually, when he confirmed that this area was safe, he landed and kept his wings.\n\nThe strong eagle wings were pitch-black like steel. After Fang Yuan stopped using eagle rise Gu, the wings vanished into thin air, as one or two black feathers were left floating in the air, landing on the grass.\n\nFang Yuan willed and activated big lizard house Gu.\n\nImmediately, a mystical light shot out from his aperture, landing in front of him.\n\nThe light expanded and grew, as a big lizard house Gu eventually appeared.\n\nThe lizard opened its mouth and shot out its tongue, showing the door in its mouth.\n\nThe tongue was like a red carpet ladder, as Fang Yuan stepped on it, the door opened automatically. After he entered the lizard house Gu, the door closed on its own, as the lizard closed its huge mouth without a gap.\n\nAlthough Fang Yuan was energetic, he was still of mortal body, when fatigue accumulates to a degree, he will need to rest to ensure that he stays at peak condition in terms of mind and body.\n\nChichichichi…\n\nAfter Fang Yuan got into the lizard house, he heard some noises outside.\n\nHis gaze concentrated as he muttered: “As expected, it is the blissful snow bats…”\n\nFang Yuan had already understood the rules, when day turns to night, large groups of blissful snow bats would fly out.\n\nThe blissful snow bats were pure white like snow, they were furry and did not look ugly like ordinary bats, in fact they were rather cute.\n\nSuch a beast group was huge in scale, each group had about several hundreds of thousands of bats. Among them were beast kings, and myriad beast kings were very common, there were even snow bat beast emperors.\n\nEven with Fang Yuan’s dual aperture and killer move like four arm wind king, he could not fight against them, he could only avoid them.\n\nThe snow bats only hunted in the air, eating the particles in the air or flying worms. The big lizard house Gu was not part of their food chain. But because of Fang Yuan’s vigilance, he moved the big lizard house Gu to the back of the slope.\n\nThe big lizard curled up into a ball, from the sky, it resembled a huge rock.\n\nFang Yuan was on the bed as he slept, but before long, the cries of the blissful snow bats became very erratic, as wolf howls could be heard as well.\n\n“What’s going on?” Fang Yuan was woken up by this noise, he opened his eyes and got up from bed, going to the window.\n\nOnly to see that in the silvery backdrop, two beast groups were fighting.\n\nThe snow-white lump had a grand scale, it was the blissful snow bats. As for the dark-green lump, it was a pack of azure wolves, although they were fewer in numbers, they fought fiercely and had great cooperation.\n\nAlthough they were many snow bats, under the wolves’ attacks, they suffered huge losses.\n\nFang Yuan’s brows lifted, feeling slightly shocked.\n\nAzure wolf had a trace of the desolate beast heavenly wolf’s bloodline, thus it could float in mid air even as a cub. A mature azure wolf can use this talent to its limits, able to run freely in the air.\n\nAzure wolves were elites, they were different from ordinary wolf groups. Among the azure wolf group, each azure wolf was at least a hundred beast king!\n\nAzure wolf groups were often small, but they had great battle strength. But regardless of how strong a wolf group is, they cannot withstand the trial of time, and the trials of mortality.\n\nRight now, in northern plains’ sky, barely any azure wolves could be seen. They were getting rarer, going to be extinct soon.\n\nHowever, as the largest blessed land in northern plains, Imperial Court blessed land had such a huge scaled azure wolf group, it was not a surprise.\n\nThe wolves got more energetic as they fought, as the bat group gradually got into a disadvantage, after leaving behind several tens of thousands of corpses, they escaped.\n\nThe azure wolves did not have many deaths, most of the azure wolves landed on the ground and started consuming the bat corpses. Some of them remained in the air, looking around and staying vigilant.\n\nFang Yuan’s heart was moved: “After entering the blessed land, my wolf group had scattered. Imperial Court blessed land is too wide, I cannot gather them here in such a short time. This azure wolf group is really timely, not only can they fly to keep up with my pace, they can even protect me, in the future when we encounter bat groups, we can just charge through.”\n\nAt the same time, several wolves found Fang Yuan’s big lizard house Gu and surrounded it.\n\nFang Yuan left the Gu house immediately and kept the big lizard house Gu, charging towards the myriad beast king in the sky.\n\nThe wolf group went into a commotion as they attacked Fang Yuan from all directions.\n\nBut the azure wolves which had just eaten were moving sluggishly, their battle intent had also decreased severely. This was the best time for Fang Yuan to subdue the myriad wolf king.\n\nFang Yuan snickered, he turned left and right, making circles in the air. With his flying master attainment, these azure wolves could only chase after him fruitlessly.\n\nThe myriad wolf king that Fang Yuan was going after was different from the other two myriad wolf kings, in the earlier battle, it had charged ahead and sustained some injuries, as well as losing some wild Gu on it. Fang Yuan had paid close attention to it earlier, and knew all the wild Gu worms currently on it.\n\nGoing up to the myriad wolf king, Fang Yuan activated the killer move four arm wind king and thrashed the wolf king.\n\nThis unlucky myriad wolf king was beaten into a daze by Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan used this chance to activate rank five wolf enslavement Gu, subduing it.\n\nOnce it joined Fang Yuan, it howled and a third of the azure wolf group changed sides along with it.\n\nFang Yuan laughed loudly, it was dangerous to subdue a myriad wolf king under the attack of the wolf group, but now that he had succeeded, the situation was different.\n\nWith the wolf group, the situation was overturned.\n\nUnder Fang Yuan’s manipulation, the wolf group attacked from left and right, cooperating with him and surrounding the second azure myriad wolf king.\n\nThe wild wolf group attacked furiously, as Fang Yuan used his wolf group to form a line of defense, protecting himself. He himself, engaged with the myriad wolf king.\n\nAfter fifteen minutes, Fang Yuan subdued the second myriad wolf king.\n\nVictory was assured!\n\nThe final myriad wolf king saw this and immediately ran, bringing its subordinates to escape with it.\n\nFang Yuan first stopped his bleeding and checked his own injuries. After checking the battlefield, he kept the big lizard house Gu and shifted the campsite.\n\nThis area was filled with the intense smell of blood, quickly, waves and waves of beast groups were attracted. If Fang Yuan continued staying there, he would be disturbed endlessly.\n\nAbout ten li away, he rested for four hours before flapping his wings and continuing his journey.\n\nBut different from before, Fang Yuan was now surrounded by two azure myriad wolf kings, thirty-eight thousand beast kings, and two hundred fifty-six hundred beast kings. It was a huge force.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, six days of travelling went by.\n\nIn this process, Fang Yuan found three inheritances. They were small inheritances however, in Fang Yuan’s eyes, they were as good as nothing.\n\nWhat was worth mentioning was, the wolf group expanded.\n\nWith the foundation of two azure myriad wolf kings, another was subdued. This way, Fang Yuan had three azure myriad wolf kings under his control.\n\nImperial Court blessed land was a true land of treasures. There were huge beast groups within, and even the rare azure wolf was a common species here.\n\nOther than the azure wolves, Fang Yuan subdued batches of night wolves, wind wolves, turtleback wolves, and vermillion flame wolves along the way.\n\nThese wolves were originally his to begin with, except that they were scattered after entering the blessed land. Fang Yuan had only found a small portion of them by now.\n\nChibiGeneral So now he’s basically Santa, except that instead of giving out presents, he takes them."
