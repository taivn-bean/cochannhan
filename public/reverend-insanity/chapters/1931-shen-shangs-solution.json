  "content": "“This is Central Continent’s Emperor City?” Ye Fan followed the main group as they walked into Emperor City, he looked around and assessed the place.\n\nHe was a Southern Border Gu Master, but he had heard of Emperor City’s famous name long ago.\n\nThis was the largest mortal city in Central Continent, or rather, the entire five regions world. Here, rank three Gu Masters were very commonly seen, but in Southern Border, rank three Gu Masters were normally authoritative elders in their clans.\n\nThis was the first time Ye Fan visited Emperor City.\n\nEmperor City lived up to its name, it was well guarded and had a grand structure, Ye Fan was not disappointed.\n\n“However, compared to an Immortal Gu House, Emperor City is far inferior.” Thinking of this, Ye Fan looked at the sky.\n\nIn the sky, there were several Immortal Gu Houses floating silently.\n\nThere was a pavilion, exquisite and small, there were countless bird cages hanging on it, birds chirped continuously. This was Heavenly Lotus Sect’s Canary Pavilion.\n\nThere was a garden that was exquisitely built, it was grand with white jade tiles and oozing with cold air, there were faint dragon roars heard occasionally, this was Ancient Soul Sect’s Immortal Gu House, Frost Dragon Manor.\n\nThere was also a seven-story tower, curtains were fluttering in the building, it was Wind Cloud Manor’s rank seven Immortal Gu House, Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nThere was also Combat Immortal Sect’s Edge Link Camp which had grand flags fluttering with the wind.\n\nOther than those, Illusion Garden, Yue Yang Palace, and Sun and Moon Temple were there.\n\nYe Fan’s master was Lu Wei Yin, he learned a lot of information regarding Gu Immortals from him, he could discern most of the famous Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nThese Immortal Gu Houses were not as large as Emperor City, but they were much more dazzling, they were the center of attention that all of the city people were talking about.\n\nAt this time, a youngster beside him sighed: “It seems that the rumors are correct. The world is going to change, immortals are going to battle. A chaotic great era is coming, the difference between mortal and immortal will shrink! This is our plan too, isn’t that right, Brother Ye?”\n\nYe Fan looked at the youngster as he nodded: “You are correct, Brother Hong.”\n\nSimilar to the previous life, Ye Fan and Hong Yi met in the Central Continent Refinement Path Convention and became sworn brothers after they interacted.\n\nHong Yi smiled: “This Refinement Path Convention is unprecedented, let those Gu Immortals fight in the sky, it is not something we can interfere in.”\n\n“Haha, that makes sense, let us have a true competition this time!” Ye Fan patted Hong Yi’s shoulders.\n\nThe two brothers were filled with fighting spirit.\n\nHong Yi said: “I have a feeling that the eventual winner of this Refinement Path Convention will be one of us.”\n\nShen Shang’s ears twitched, he heard the entire conversation between Hong Yi and Ye Fan without missing a word.\n\nThese two were mortals, but Shen Shang kept a trace of his concentration on them at all times.\n\n“In the future five regions chaotic war, these two youngsters likely have an opportunity to become immortal.” Shen Shang was a human path quasi-supreme, he had a strong premonition when it came to humans.\n\nOver at Heavenly Court, people’s united hearts and other human path killer moves were all used already, Unfettered Scholar and Zheng Qing had been expelled.\n\nBut Shen Shang still managed to disguise himself and enter the final competition ground, he was not suspected at all.\n\nHe was after all a rank eight Gu Immortal and also a human path quasi-supreme grandmaster!\n\nShen Shang observed his surroundings, he became gradually excited.\n\n“My estimations earlier were not wrong, this Emperor City is one of the main human veins of Central Continent!”\n\nMountains had mountain veins, the earth had earth veins, and humans had human veins.\n\n“Emperor City was created by Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable, after so many years of relocation and movement, it still remained as the largest gathering spot of humans, it stayed on the trail of Central Continent’s human vein all along.”\n\n“This place produces human talents, it is because of Central Continent’s main human vein. Heavenly Court’s generations of Immortal Venerables have left their human path methods here, hmm… I can vaguely sense their existence.”\n\nFang Yuan used his rebirth as the reason to urge Shen Shang to take action and try to unravel the various venerable human path methods.\n\nThis was a challenging mission, it spurred on Shen Shang’s morale and ambition.\n\nFang Yuan and the rest could not sense any of the traces of these human path killer moves. But for Shen Shang, he could trace and locate them.\n\nThus, he disguised himself and entered Emperor City, he finally found a chance to destroy the venerable killer moves.\n\n“Heavenly Court is collecting human will and storing it inside Heavenly Court for use.”\n\n“That place is too tightly defended, if we cannot enter Heavenly Court, we will not be able to destroy the human will. If we cannot destroy the human will, we cannot drain them of this resource.”\n\n“However… taking action here will also have superb effects.”\n\n“Heavenly Court is collecting human will, Emperor City plays a crucial role in this process, it is the largest shipment area they have to transport the human will.”\n\n“If I destroy this place, Heavenly Court’s efficiency in gathering human will would fall greatly.”\n\nBut Shen Shang did not plan to cause destruction.\n\nHe had a greater objective.\n\nHe wanted to follow the traces with Emperor City as the anchor to find the venerable human path killer moves and reverse-deduce the profundities of their human path methods, to try to steal their knowledge!\n\nShen Shang was confident and daring.\n\nHe was not satisfied with just the reputation of unraveling a venerable killer move, he wanted to master the venerable human path methods and gain much more strength in the process.\n\n“If my human path methods improve, it might be possible to get rid of the problem of the black fire, I will not go berserk anymore.”\n\nHairy Foot Mountain battlefield.\n\nFive colored smoke miasma rumbled, Southern Border’s Gu Immortals and Heavenly Court’s main forces had already fought for a long time.\n\nBay Pavilion, Flying Sand Pavilion, and Unfixed Manor were heavily damaged, they went to the second defensive line to get repaired.\n\nAt the front lines, there were four rank eights from Southern Border, as well as two rank eight Immortal Gu Houses, Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building and Great Space Temple.\n\nHeavenly Court’s main forces had no deaths, their morale was high.\n\nZhao Shan He prepared his killer move again, his aura was surging.\n\nZhan Bu Du quickly shouted: “Stop him! He is going to use that move again!”\n\nWu Yong and Yi Hao Fang gritted their teeth, they wanted to charge in but Ye Qiao Zi and Vortex Space Boy stopped them.\n\nZhou Xiong Xin and Flesh Whip Immortal joined hands to obstruct Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhu Que Er and Wan Zi Hong went from the right and left, bypassing the battlefield to attack the five regional limit formation directly.\n\nWu Yong and the rest were left with no choice, they had to return to being defensive.\n\nThey had too few people, it was hard enough to defend, they were not as agile and flexible as Heavenly Court’s group.\n\nZhao Shan He successfully used his killer move, he opened his mouth, he sucked in all of the surrounding five colored smoke.\n\nA large amount of smoke was sucked into his stomach, which expanded at an observable rate. At the same time, his face and muscles turned multicolored.\n\nZhao Shan He actually swallowed the five colored smoke, creating a temporary cleared out area.\n\nWithout the restraints of the five colored smoke, Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals were able to use their full power, they unleashed all sorts of killer moves with terrifying power.\n\nWu Yong and the rest resisted, but their defensive line was not tight, killer moves were directed to get through the cracks, after a rough filter by their defenses, the rest landed on the five regional limit formation.\n\nThe five regional limit formation shook intensely, a large number of Gu worms died, a weakened Formation Spirit quickly tried to repair it.\n\nZhan Bu Du’s expression was ugly.\n\nRelying on Zhao Shan He’s food path method, Heavenly Court managed to make a breakthrough, each time they used this method, the five regional limit formation suffered immense damage.\n\nEven though they were repairing it at full speed, it could not keep up with the waves of attacks that kept on coming.\n\nAs damage accumulated, the five regional limit formation started to get into a dangerous spot.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nEmperor City.\n\nThe final round of the competition was racing against the clock to start.\n\nShen Shang was secretly happy.\n\nHe started to refine Gu, using this as a cover, he secretly prepared his killer move.\n\n“We finally arrived!” Fang Di Chang drove Divine Bean Palace as he charged at the front.\n\nBehind him was Western Desert’s main troops.\n\n“To battle!”\n\n“Force them back!”\n\n“Defend Emperor City to the death.”\n\nCentral Continent’s troops cheered and shouted, they faced off against Western Desert’s Immortal Gu Houses as battle erupted.\n\n“Wonderful!” Shen Shang, who was paying attention to the outside world, cheered, with Central Continent’s forces being restrained, he had no worries left.\n\nRight at this moment!\n\nBam.\n\nHe erupted with a strong Gu Immortal aura, he shouted as profound white light pierced through the hall, radiating in the entire Emperor City.\n\n“The venerables have passed away, all of your human path methods should go as well!” Shen Shang’s eyes shined with piercing and blinding light.\n\nPuff!\n\nAt the next moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood, his body cracked as his lungs burst, his intestines blew into tiny pieces that shot out of the wounds all over his body.\n\nFailure!\n\n“How can this be?!” Shen Shang could not believe this, he stared with wide eyes: “I had already…”\n\nNot only did he fail to resolve the venerable methods, he even triggered them in advance.\n\nThis was human path killer move — Hope of the People!\n\nWhite light flew around in the sky like a snowstorm, it gathered on the bodies of the Central Continent Gu Immortals, creating a pure white halo.\n\nHuman path killer move — Heroes Among People!\n\nThe white lights surrounding the Central Continent Gu Immortals started to shrink, while the Gu Immortals’ auras started to grow.\n\nHowl!\n\nCentral Continent’s army roared, their morale soared as they charged towards Western Desert’s troops.\n\n“Oh no!” Fang Di Chang’s expression changed."
