Although Chi Gui was not able to control the Gu formation, he still could inspect the state of the Gu formation.\n\nIt was just that this would use up his energy and time, and it was rather troublesome.\n\nThis inspection immediately turned Chi Gui’s expression ashen.\n\nBa De had been observing Chi Gui, and seeing the latter’s expression change to that of shock and terror, his heart jolted and he quickly transmitted his voice: “What happened?”\n\n“Lord Wu Yi Hai is missing, the whole super Gu formation is forcibly controlled by two forces and they are fighting against each other. One has a Central Continent aura and the other has a Northern Plains aura. Just based on their auras, they are both rank eight Gu Immortals.” Chi Gui said with distress.\n\nBa De was immediately dazed.\n\nThe impact was too heavy.\n\nHe took a few deep breaths, as sweat started to appear on his forehead.\n\nToo dangerous!\n\nThis situation was too dangerous.\n\n“Wu Yi Hai has mysteriously gone missing, he is very likely to have been killed. Regardless of how the two rank eights infiltrated the super Gu formation, Wu Yi Hai has no chance with his rank seven cultivation.”\n\nBa De started to make deductions.\n\nRight now, he could not even imagine Fang Yuan was a traitor!\n\nThis was also the result of Fang Yuan paying attention to small details like changing his appearance before leaving.\n\nMore importantly, they could not even imagine that Wu Yi Hai (Fang Yuan) would mix in with Shadow Sect.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause not long ago, Ba Quan Feng, this mole in the Southern Border righteous path forces, had caused the super Gu formation to be unable to activate. At the crucial moment, Fang Yuan had saved the day and with his help, Southern Border’s righteous forces were able to bring up the second layer of the super Gu formation.\n\nThis matter had left a very deep impression on the Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals.\n\nIf such a person was Shadow Sect’s mole, how could he hinder Shadow Sect’s plan at the crucial moment?\n\n“It probably bodes ill for Wu Yi Hai, oh, now that I think of it, I am lucky I was plotted against by Ba Quan Feng. If it were me controlling the super Gu formation right now, Wu Yi Hai’s ending would have been my ending. I should be grateful to Wu Yi Hai for replacing me.” Chi Gui was inwardly thankful to Fang Yuan.\n\nWhether Wu Yi Hai was dead or not, Ba De soon accepted it.\n\nBa De had already found Wu Yi Hai an eyesore, even if Wu Yi Hai had a miserable end, he would still look at it like a joke.\n\nBut now, Ba De could not laugh.\n\n“The super Gu formation is already out of our control, Shadow Sect has retreated but Heavenly Court is still here, what is their stance?” Ba De pondered over this serious issue.\n\nPreviously, Heavenly Court and Southern Border’s righteous path had stood together to fight Shadow Sect.\n\nNow Shadow Sect had left, while Spectral Soul’s main body was captured by Duke Long.\n\nWhat stance would Heavenly Court have?\n\nBa De did not have any answer to this question.\n\nBecause, not long ago, Heavenly Court had organized a secret group to invade Northern Plains and destroy Snowy Mountain blessed land, but they had to retreat in defeat because of Longevity Heaven.\n\nThe current situation was extremely similar.\n\nHeavenly Court had organized another expedition group to Southern Border. It was not easy to say what their stance was!\n\nAlthough both belonged to the righteous path, Ba De, who had held a high position in the righteous path for a long time, knew something: Politics never placed significance on moral integrity, it was all about benefits.\n\nHow could they protect their benefits?\n\nOne word, strength!\n\nIf the super Gu formation was still in their control, Southern Border’s righteous forces would still have some confidence to negotiate with Heavenly Court.\n\nBut Wu Yi Hai was gone now, and the super Gu formation was seized by others.\n\nIt seemed to be two rank eight Gu Immortals who had seized control, and neither of them were from Southern Border.\n\nAt this time, in this situation, the more Ba De thought, the more unsightly his expression became.\n\nBut he did not waste too much time thinking.\n\nIn just a short while, he opened his dried lips and made a difficult decision: “Retreat.”\n\n“Retreat? We are giving up the super Gu formation? Our clans’ Immortal Gu are all here.” Chi Gui then pointed at those patches of dream realms: “Look at these dream realms, Heavenly Court might have a way to collect them. If we retreat, all the Immortal Gu and the dream realms will be lost, who will bear the responsibility for that?”\n\nBa De coldly glanced at Chi Gui: “Retreat if you want to retreat, if you want to remain, then remain.”\n\nLeaving behind this sentence, he recalled the last remaining Ba clan Gu Immortal and left.\n\nBa De’s decision immediately created a commotion among the Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals.\n\nBefore Ba De left, he had informed all of them regarding their current situation.\n\nWu clan and Qiao clan naturally suffered a huge blow when they heard about Wu Yi Hai being missing.\n\nThe super Gu formation was no longer in their control, most of the Southern Border Gu Immortals imitated Ba De and started to retreat.\n\nWu Liao, however, did not leave.\n\nWu Yi Hai was Wu Yong’s brother, he was now missing, his whereabouts unknown. As a Wu clan Gu Immortal, how could Wu Liao easily retreat?\n\n“I believe Lord Wu Yi Hai is alive and well.” Qiao Si Liu thought for a bit, before leaving with Qiao clan’s Gu Immortals.\n\nMost of the Southern Border Gu Immortals left, leaving behind Chi Gui, Wu Liao and a few other Gu Immortals. They chose to believe in Heavenly Court, after all, it led Central Continent’s righteous path.\n\nHeaven Overseeing Tower was still tangled up with Zuo Ye Hui, neither were able to get the upper hand.\n\nZuo Ye Hui held deep hatred towards the Heavenly Court Gu Immortals, it was not just a desire to hunt for food.\n\nThis point had clearly been calculated by Purple Mountain True Monarch.\n\nAmong Southern Border’s righteous path Gu Immortals, those that wanted to leave had left.\n\n“A mere will dares to obstruct me!” In a short while, Fairy Zi Wei was covered in the power of Star Constellation Chessboard, finally completely destroying Purple Mountain True Monarch’s will.\n\nThis rank eight wisdom path expert finally completed her goal, grasping control over this super Gu formation.\n\nHowever, she was not in the least bit happy.\n\nFang Yuan had become the leader of Shadow Sect and escaped right under her nose.\n\nFairy Zi Wei was well aware of the upper extreme heavenly eagle’s speed, she definitely would not be able to catch up to it if she were to give chase now.\n\nFairy Zi Wei’s mood was extremely bad.\n\nAfter gaining control over the super Gu formation, she immediately contacted Duke Long: “Lord Duke Long, how is the situation there?”\n\nAll she heard was a loud sound.\n\nSpace cracked open like a mirror, and from within the tear, a rank eight Gu Immortal flew out.\n\nWho else could it be but Duke Long?\n\nIt was just that, if originally, he had an aloof and domineering aura, now, his face was filled with a dark and ferocious grimace, seemingly enduring something.\n\nFairy Zi Wei’s heart jolted, immediately activating the super Gu formation to bring Duke Long in.\n\n“Lord Duke Long, what’s wrong?”\n\nDuke Long said with clenched teeth: “Spectral Soul Demon Venerable is indeed Spectral Soul Demon Venerable! I had just moved the door of life and death into my phantom aperture, when that remnant soul of Spectral Soul actually used the door of life and death’s power to try to devour my soul. We need to return to Heavenly Court quickly, and use the power of Heavenly Court to separate Spectral Soul’s remnant soul from my body and suppress it!”\n\nFairy Zi Wei’s heart sank, she had not expected the situation to be this serious.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable had been a grand rank nine when alive, even though he was schemed against by heaven’s will and taken captive by Heavenly Court, the moment he was given the slightest chance, the retaliation he unleashed was actually so ferocious.\n\n“Yes.” Fairy Zi Wei quickly responded, she naturally would carry out Duke Long’s order without doubt.\n\n“But how should we handle Zuo Ye Hui, along with these Southern Border Gu Immortals and Fang Yuan, who has already escaped?” Fairy Zi Wei thought for a bit and asked.\n\nDuke Long said with no hesitation: “Don’t worry about Zuo Ye Hui, it cannot catch up to Heaven Overseeing Tower. Forget about these Southern Border righteous forces, Spectral Soul’s main body is already within me. From start to finish, we have not fallen out with Southern Border, both of us belong to righteous path, massacring righteous forces is not beneficial to Central Continent’s future grand unification of other regions. As for Fang Yuan….”\n\nAs he said this, Duke Long paused and looked at Fairy Zi Wei.\n\nAn ashamed look flashed past Fairy Zi Wei’s face: “I did not handle it properly.”\n\nHowever, Duke Long smiled instead: “I don’t believe you didn’t use any method.”\n\nFairy Zi Wei answered: “Lord Duke Long is wise, that thief Fang Yuan has already been struck by my investigative method, as well as the rest of Shadow Sect’s members.”\n\n“Good, Southern Border’s righteous path reinforcements are coming from all directions, we need to retreat.” Duke Long nodded.\n\nFinally, the reinforcements of Southern Border’s super clans successively arrived at the remains of Yi Tian Mountain.\n\nWhat they saw was a ruined battlefield.\n\nDream realms were everywhere, piled up messily. They were no longer round like before, but were like a range of mountains, scattered here and there.\n\nThe super Gu formation had already disappeared without a trace.\n\nSince Fairy Zi Wei had already gained control of the super Gu formation, she naturally could break it down, many of the Immortal Gu of Southern Border’s righteous forces were taken away by Heavenly Court.\n\nDuke Long and Fairy Zi Wei then entered Heaven Overseeing Tower and flew to white heaven.\n\nZuo Ye Hui did not intend to let them off, charging into white heaven.\n\nMore and more Southern Border Gu Immortals gathered here, the scale was so large that it was rarely seen even once in a hundred years.\n\nWu Yong, Chi Qu You and the others looked at the battlefield with ashen expressions.\n\nThey had suffered tremendous losses this time!"
