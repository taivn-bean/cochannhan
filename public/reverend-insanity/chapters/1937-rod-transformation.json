  "content": "Eastern Sea’s eight Gu Immortals had already arrived in white heaven, they destroyed many stars.\n\nTheir ambition was not as large as Southern Border, Northern Plains, and Western Desert, they only wanted to plunder some Central Continent resources and expend its foundation.\n\nBecause they were worried that Heavenly Court would send reinforcements to stop them, they targeted the stars in white heaven instead.\n\nTheir strategy had coincidentally become the most crucial point in the entire battle right now!\n\nAmong them were Zhang Yin, Granny Rong, and the other dragon generals, Wu Shuai did not recall them, they were left in this group, to try to destroy the stars.\n\nWu Shuai made a wise decision.\n\nIf only Shen Cong Sheng, Qing Yue An, Hua Cai Yun, and Song Qi Yuan were left, they might not have enough guts to destroy the stars.\n\nEastern Sea’s eight immortals were quite efficient in destroying the stars.\n\nThe eight of them arrived in front of a giant sized star.\n\nThe star was so huge that these eight immortals felt very minute.\n\nHeavenly Court scattered countless stars in white heaven, they were mutually connected, creating a web that had its own arrangements.\n\nEach area had a giant star as the formation core, around the giant star were many large sized stars.\n\nAnd around the large sized stars were countless mid and small sized stars, flying around casually, they did not have fixed locations.\n\nSong Qi Yuan first flew onto the giant star as he shut his eyes, quietly sensing the connection between the stars.\n\nMore than ten breaths later, he shut his eyes, activating a light path killer move as he pointed far away.\n\nEach time he pointed, a sharp profound light would shoot out of his finger at lightning speed, vanishing into the horizon.\n\nFar away, mid and small sized stars exploded into smithereens.\n\nThis light path killer move was very special, it could trace the source of any light and attack it. It could even target gazes.\n\nIn the previous life, Song Qi Yuan used this move to destroy a star that Fang Yuan refined, causing his star eyes Immortal Gu to fail.\n\nIn this life, Song Qi Yuan used this move against Heavenly Court, the effect was immediate as well.\n\nAfter Song Qi Yuan destroyed all of the stars he could sense, he stopped and nodded at Qing Yue An.\n\nImmortal killer move — Myriad Mountain Ranges!\n\nQing Yue An gave a cry as the phantom image of countless mountains appeared, the entire mountain range crashed into the giant star.\n\nThe giant star was huge but it was just an immortal material, under the attack of the rank eight killer move, it shattered and was destroyed, breaking into countless star fragments.\n\nAlmost at the same time the giant star was destroyed, Fairy Zi Wei, who was within Heavenly Court’s transportation formation, sensed it.\n\nHer expression changed.\n\nThe destruction of one giant star was not an issue. Heavenly Court scattered many stars in white heaven, the loss of one was insignificant.\n\nBut in this situation, it had a different implication.\n\nCurrently, Northern Plains’ immortals and Fang Yuan’s clones were attacking all the important areas of Heavenly Court, Fairy Zi Wei had to activate the formation to transport them away.\n\nThe formation was constantly activated, it was like a person running while keeping a dangerous balance. If the person steps on a rock, no matter how small it is, they would lose their balance and fall, getting injured. The faster they are running, the heavier their injuries when they fall.\n\nThe transportation formation was being used so intensely now, if any errors happen when the destroyed star is needed for the process, the transportation formation would be severely damaged by its own backlash, it might get destroyed.\n\nFairy Zi Wei had thought that these Eastern Sea immortals held the lowest threat to them, but to think that in this situation and time, the eight Eastern Sea immortals were her most fatal threat!\n\nShe had to be careful now, any suspicious stars could not be used now.\n\nFang Yuan acutely sensed the changes in the formation, he attacked wildly while activating myriad self, and also transmitting information to Shen Cong Sheng.\n\nShen Cong Sheng received Fang Yuan’s message and understood Heavenly Court’s situation, he became very excited.\n\nHe urged the seven immortals: “Now is our best chance, Fang Yuan has already made his move, Heavenly Court cannot divert its attention. The more stars we destroy, the more problems Heavenly Court will face. Heavenly Court’s main forces are restrained in Hairy Foot Mountain, while Heavenly Court itself is being attacked by Longevity Heaven and Fang Yuan. If we do well here, we might have a chance of destroying Heavenly Court!”\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s words raised the morale of the other seven immortals, their efficiency went up at once.\n\nHairy Foot Mountain battlefield.\n\nThe sharp sound of phoenix chirping pierced the eardrums and ran through the battlefield.\n\nThe source of the sound was Prince Feng Xian’s killer move — Phoenix Chirping Divine Flame!\n\nThe flames burned with raging intensity, coiling around Di Zang Sheng’s body as it was set ablaze.\n\nAt the other side, Bai Cang Shui also used her killer move, countless water waves rushed towards Di Zang Sheng’s body without stopping even for a moment.\n\nDi Zang Sheng was attacked by more than just these two people, it was just too large, Heavenly Court’s immortals had their own area to target and attack.\n\nDi Zang Sheng roared continuously, it was attacked by flames and water, lightning and poison, but it still rushed towards the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation, the attacks of the Heavenly Court immortals did not distract it successfully.\n\nIts performance did not fit historical records, back then, Di Zang Sheng caused chaos and attacked everything in its sight, it was easily drawn away, it had never shown such a clear objective.\n\n“Oh no! This legendary immemorial beast has likely been enslaved.” Zhou Xiong Xin shouted.\n\nHeavenly Court’s main forces did not have wisdom path Gu Immortals, but Zhou Xiong Xin cultivated information path, he was most skilled at collecting information and clues.\n\nHe even had information path killer moves that could mimic wisdom path effects.\n\nAfter fighting for some time, Zhou Xiong Xin immediately deduced the truth behind Di Zang Sheng.\n\nDi Zang Sheng was attacked by the Heavenly Court immortals, it was covered in injuries. In terms of defense, it was inferior to Duke Long, it also had no wild Immortal Gu, it was fighting with its own innate abilities.\n\nEvery time it waved its claws, it could create a gale. The Heavenly Court immortals avoided them, none of them wanting to try the feeling of being caught by Di Zang Sheng.\n\nEach of its roars could set off shocking waves of sound, violently impacting everyone’s eardrums and hearts.\n\nIts size was too large, even if it suffered countless blows, it was not a big deal to its entire body.\n\nIt endured the furious attacks of the Heavenly Court Gu Immortals, it persevered towards the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation as it began to cause destruction.\n\nHeavenly Court’s immortals felt a sense of helplessness, against Di Zang Sheng, even if they used their full strength, they were like rats trying to topple an elephant.\n\n“What do I do?”\n\n“At this rate, the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation cannot sustain itself.”\n\n“Attacking the enemy will save it, we have to face offense with offense!”\n\nHeavenly Court’s immortals had rich experience, they quickly found a countermeasure.\n\nVortex Space Boy and Jun Shen Guang moved ahead while Zhu Que Er and Zhu Que Er became the middle group, they all moved towards the five regional limit formation.\n\nAt this moment, Di Zang Sheng opened its mouth, an Immortal Gu House flew out.\n\nThis Immortal Gu House was shining in orange-gold light, it was grand and overbearing, this was the rank eight Immortal Gu House — Dragon Palace.\n\nA wave of smoke flew out of Dragon Palace like an illusory dream.\n\n“Dream path killer move?!” Heavenly Court’s immortals recognized it, they were shocked and fearful, quickly dodging.\n\nWherever dreamy light smoke went, Heavenly Court’s immortals dodged and gave way.\n\nThe light smoke covered the five regional limit formation and quickly retrieved it.\n\nHeavenly Court’s immortals tried to use methods to attack dreamy light smoke but dream path killer moves were unstoppable in this era, all of their hard work ended up in vain.\n\nThe five regional limit formation was brought into Dragon Palace, Zhan Bu Du stored it away, after landing inside Dragon Palace, he met with Wu Shuai.\n\nWu Shuai used Dragon Palace’s methods to immediately heal him.\n\nHeavenly Court was a strong foe, even though they were in a disadvantage, they could still retaliate. Heavenly Court’s main forces used the best tactic, forcing Zhan Bu Du to store the five regional limit formation.\n\nThis formation had already been attacked countless times, it was at its limits already.\n\nNot only did Zhan Bu Du need healing, this five regional limit formation also needed to be repaired.\n\nWithout the formation, even though there was still five colored smoke in the battlefield, it lost its source and quickly dwindled.\n\nWu Shuai drove Dragon Palace directly into the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation with Di Zang Sheng, without tangling with Heavenly Court’s members.\n\n“Hold on! We need to hold on!” The Gu Immortals controlling the formation shouted, the atmosphere was tense and solemn.\n\nIn order to protect Hairy Foot Mountain and Infallible blessed land, they had to keep the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation up.\n\nHowever, be it the five colored smoke or Di Zang Sheng, they were fatally dangerous to the formation.\n\nAfter entering the formation, Di Zang Sheng’s strength rose greatly.\n\nIt was restricted in the five colored smoke earlier, after all, it was a Central Continent legendary immemorial beast, it was not from the nine heavens.\n\nImmortal killer move — Unlimited Wind!\n\nWhile Heavenly Court’s main forces retreated, Wu Yong found a chance and permanently expended wind path dao marks to unleash the unceasing tornado.\n\nThe tornado rampaged, suppressing the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation from the outside, adding an additional problem to Heavenly Court.\n\nEmperor City battlefield.\n\nMyriad Statue Palace and Divine Bean Palace helped each other, firmly holding Western Desert’s ground.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor charged into the battle alone, using all sorts of powerful transformation path killer moves to force back Yue Yang Palace and Frost Dragon Manor.\n\nLike Zhang Fei Xiong and Flesh Whip Immortal, Thousand Transformations Ancestor also had the ability to fight Immortal Gu Houses with his body!\n\nBut the overall situation was, Central Continent still had the upper hand.\n\nThey were all affected by heroes among people, this human path killer move was indeed a venerable method, it could not be assessed with common sense.\n\nWithin Emperor City, the competition was also at a crucial stage.\n\nHong Yi stared at the fire with his full concentration. No matter how the immortals fought outside, they could not disturb him.\n\nYe Fan was the same, he wholeheartedly wanted to compete with Hong Yi. But different from Hong Yi, he was using a light path refinement method, aurora lights constantly moved vividly, reflecting off his face.\n\nIn the competition ground, one by one, Gu Masters failed, success dao marks were sent to Infallible blessed land by batches.\n\nNext, the success dao marks in Infallible blessed land were extracted by Heavenly Court and sent to Yuan Qiong Du.\n\nYuan Qiong Du controlled the refinement path Gu formation, he continued to repair fate Gu, he was making quick progress.\n\nWithin this refinement path Gu formation, there were Cong Yan and Che Wei defending the place with their full strength.\n\nAs Northern Plains’ Gu Immortals got near the formation, starlight would land on them, they would be teleported out without resistance.\n\n“As expected of Lady Zi Wei.”\n\n“She is so dependable.”\n\nChe Wei and Cong Yan sighed.\n\n“Persevere, persevere!” Fairy Zi Wei was covered in sweat now, her face was pale and her head was emitting steam from overheating.\n\nShe encouraged herself continuously: “The situation is still within my grasp, persistence will lead to victory!”\n\nBut at the next moment, Fang Yuan, who was on Myriad Year Flying Warship, laughed loudly.\n\nImmortal killer move — Myriad Beings Assimilation Transformation.\n\nImmortal killer move — Falling Star Rod Transformation!\n\nHe suddenly turned into a huge rod, black and thick.\n\nNext, he used a star path killer move — Leading Countless Stars!\n\n“Oh no!” Fairy Zi Wei’s expression changed, she felt like she was sitting on a wild horse carriage that could not stop.\n\nThe horse pulling it was rampaging, even if she held the reins, she could not stop this horse carriage anymore.\n\nBoom!\n\nAt the next moment, the entire transportation formation self-detonated, starlight specks faded away, no longer shining down.\n\nFairy Zi Wei suffered an immense backlash, she was at the point of near death, falling unconscious."
