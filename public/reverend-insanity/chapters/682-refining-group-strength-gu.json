  "content": "Chapter 682: Refining Group Strength Gu\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nFang Yuan could faintly sense Hei Lou Lan’s tribulation would result in a huge battle.\n\nHei Cheng was an experienced rank seven Gu Immortal, his battle strength surpassing Fang Yuan’s. Xue Song Zi was the owner of the seventh peak of Snowy Mountain blessed land and was also not an easy opponent.\n\nEven if Hei Cheng and Xue Song Zi did not create trouble, a tribulation of the Great Strength True Martial Physique would far surpass the severity of those of normal people.\n\nFang Yuan immediately started making preparations after he returned to Hu Immortal blessed land.\n\nHe needed to raise his battle strength in a short period of time. Battle strength usually depended on four aspects: immortal essence, killer moves, Immortal Gu and battle attainments.\n\nFang Yuan was already very strong in his individual fighting attainment and it would be difficult to raise in a short period of time.\n\nHe could only concentrate on the other three aspects to raise his battle strength.\n\nFang Yuan first looked at his funds.\n\nTo connect luck with Ye Fan, Fang Yuan made a trip to southern border and returned, costing him two beads of green grape immortal essence, which meant he had seventeen remaining.\n\nIt was clear this amount was far from enough in a huge battle. According to Fang Yuan’s previous life’s memories, it was normal to spend dozens of beads of immortal essence in a huge battle, and sometimes it could even surpass a hundred.\n\nFang Yuan also possessed a lot of Immortal Gu, thus he urgently needed to replenish his green grape immortal essence.\n\nAnd to replenish his green grape immortal essence, Fang Yuan only had one way and that was to refine immortal essence stones.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan only had eleven and half immortal essence stones on him.\n\nFang Yuan entered the underground cave and appeared before wisdom Gu again.\n\n“Wisdom Gu, I brought you some rather interesting stuff.” He greeted.\n\nIn <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, wisdom Gu communicated with Ren Zu frequently, but legends were not exempt from exaggeration.\n\nFang Yuan was also probing in regards to this.\n\nNo matter what he said, wisdom Gu would remain silent, instead, the wisdom light halo flickered a few times.\n\nFang Yuan laughed.\n\nAccording to his previous experiences with wisdom Gu, the flickering of the light of wisdom represented wisdom Gu’s agreement.\n\nUpon this, he smoothly took out the lingzhi king’s heart and planted it on the spot.\n\nWithin a few breaths of time, the soil ruptured and stems of small lingzhi mushrooms sprang out, which then rapidly grew and hardened, reaching the heights of tables and chairs.\n\nHu Immortal blessed land’s soil quality was different from the soil quality in Universal Life Academy’s land, and was not suitable for the growth of mushrooms.\n\nThis was the limit that the mushrooms could grow here.\n\nFang Yuan did not feel any regrets as it was just a passing thought from him. He then casually sat down on a lingzhi mushroom.\n\nThe lingzhi trembled violently, but unexpectedly was able to bear the heavy weight of Fang Yuan’s immortal zombie body.\n\nThis cave had been empty before, but now it was no longer dull; wisdom Gu was like a curious baby, flying and fluttering around the shorter mushrooms. At first, its speed was slow and careful, but soon its flying tracks revealed its cheerful state, like a baby finding an interesting toy.\n\n“Wisdom Gu, let’s get back to the main matter.” Fang Yuan looked on for a while before speaking.\n\nWisdom Gu stopped on top of a lingzhi and emitted the light of wisdom again, which shrouded Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan silently activated delight in water and mountain Gu and began to deduce an Immortal Gu remnant recipe.\n\nSeven days later, he had succeeded in perfecting three Immortal Gu remnant recipes. Using a stargate, he completed the transaction with Lang Ya land spirit, gaining forty immortal essence stones.\n\nAccording to the price agreed upon beforehand, perfecting an over ninety percent complete Immortal Gu remnant recipe would pay off ten immortal essence stones, while perfecting an eighty percent or more completed Immortal Gu remnant recipe would pay off twenty immortal essence stones.\n\nAmong the Immortal Gu remnant recipes Fang Yuan perfected this time, two were ninety percent completed remnant recipes while one was an eighty-nine percent completed remnant recipe.\n\nNot all Immortal Gu remnant recipes with Lang Ya land spirit were ninety percent or over completed remnant recipes, there were many with lower completion rates.\n\nFang Yuan obtained many immortal essence stones in every transaction but he also had to spend a lot of immortal essence stones to completely deduce the Immortal Gu remnant recipes. Normally, his net profits were around twenty-six immortal essence stones in every transaction with Lang Ya land spirit.\n\nHe got a piece of good news from Little Hu Immortal land spirit when he returned to Hu Immortal blessed land: A Gu Immortal seemed to have found the dead body of a six headed snake and its parts and organs were being separately sold in treasure yellow heaven.\n\nFang Yuan immediately activated divine sense Gu and connected to treasure yellow heaven using his Eight Arm Immortal identity to contact the seller.\n\nHis calamity beckoning Gu fed on the black blood of the desolate beast six headed snake.\n\nHowever, when Fang Yuan saw the store, there was skin, flesh, bones, eyes and snake tendons, but there was no blood for sale.\n\n“When I found this desolate beast carcass by accident, the six headed snake had already been dead for close to a hundred years. Thus, the black blood had completely seeped out. I am truly sorry.” The seller replied.\n\nFang Yuan discerned the corpse of the six headed snake and saw that the Gu Immortal was indeed telling the truth.\n\nFang Yuan was not discouraged, however. And still decided to buy the bones of this six headed snake.\n\nThe six headed snake was a desolate beast with strength comparable to rank six Gu Immortals. Its whole body was a treasure and every part could be used in the process of Gu refinement.\n\nFang Yuan had a lot of money on hand, directly buying off the whole skeleton, spending three immortal essence stones.\n\nThe bone marrow in the bones could produce blood. In his previous life, Fang Yuan in his previous life was a blood path expert and excelled in extracting blood. With this skeleton, calamity beckoning Gu’s food was taken care of.\n\nAfter buying the skeleton, Fang Yuan then went to the store of Immortal Monkey King Shi Lei.\n\nAs expected, divine senses were moving around frequently here and the business was thriving, all because of the Gu refinement material – stone monkey fur.\n\nShi Lei did not personally stay in treasure yellow heaven, instead leaving behind a proud will to look over the store.\n\nWisdom path inheritances were rare, but wisdom path Gu were not rare in treasure yellow heaven. Almost all Gu Immortals had some for the convenience in trading in treasure yellow heaven. If not, Fang Yuan would not have bought so many wisdom path Gu back then.\n\n“How much are you selling this stone monkey fur for?” Fang Yuan inquired Shi Lei’s will.\n\nShi Lei’s will stiffly said: “One immortal essence stone for one hundred pieces of fur!”\n\nEven Fang Yuan who was very experienced was shocked by this price: “How is it so expensive?”\n\nShi Lei’s proud will raised his head: “Expensive? You can go buy in other places then.”\n\nFang Yuan snorted inwardly, this stone monkey fur was researched by Shi Lei, how could other places sell it? This was the benefit of monopolizing the market, the price could be casually set. On the contrary, even though the price was so high, many Gu Immortals were buying it.\n\nWhich Gu Immortal did not have Gu recipes and Immortal Gu remnant recipes! Maybe one or two them might happen to require this stone monkey fur as a refinement material.\n\nThere were also a portion of Gu Immortals who had other intentions.\n\nThey bought stone monkey fur to attempt to research the secret of its production. If their blessed lands could also produce it, they could get a share of these exorbitant profits.\n\n“Don’t say I didn’t tell you later, if you want to research the production of this stone monkey fur, you need at least a thousand strands of fur. If it is any less, you won’t be able to research anything.” Shi Lei’s proud will also knew of the Gu Immortals’ intention and instead used this to peddle the goods, not in the least worried of the secret of stone monkey fur’s production being researched by others.\n\nFang Yuan attempted to haggle but Shi Lei’s proud will did not yield, impatiently saying: “Go away, go away, don’t make a disturbance if you are not buying! There are plenty of other buyers! A poor wretch, and still wishing to buy ancient Gu refinement material!”\n\nFang Yuan snorted.\n\nImmortal Monkey King Shi Lei was a rank seven Gu Immortal with a fiery and arrogant temper. Not only was he good at managing his blessed land, he also had outstanding battle strength.\n\nHe was conceited but it was true he had the capital to be conceited.\n\nDuring the five regions chaotic war, he had dominated a territory. Later when Feng Jiu Ge perished while invading Lang Ya blessed land, there was no one that could suppress Shi Lei and his battle strength grew to the extent that even central continent’s ten great sects could not restrain him.\n\nHe was unruly and untamed, not willing to be under anyone, creating chaos in central continent and even publicly announcing he would attack leading immortals!\n\nA great battle was imminent and Fang Yuan urgently required stone monkey fur to refine group strength Gu, thus regardless of how haughty Shi Lei’s proud will was, he could only suffer this grievance silently and buy stone monkey fur.\n\nHe used five immortal essence stones to buy five hundred stone monkey fur.\n\nWith stone monkey fur on hand, Fang Yuan started refining group strength Gu.\n\nGroup strength Gu was an extinct Gu classified under strength path; its ability was to converge the strength of a group into one. If it was matched with the killer move myriad self, it would greatly raise Fang Yuan’s strength.\n\nFang Yuan did not want to refine just one rank five group strength Gu, the more he had the better. At this moment, the old hairy men he had purchased before could finally display their worth.\n\nThese old hairy men did not have long to live but each of them was a refinement path expert. Fang Yuan divided the group strength Gu recipe into different parts, leaving the unimportant, high success rate and repetitive procedures for the hairy men to work on. And he, as a refinement path master, concentrated on the crucial procedures.\n\nThey worked for three days and three nights without any rest, refining a total of forty-five rank five group strength Gu.\n\nGu refinement had its own difficulty, the higher the rank, the easier it was to fail. If every Gu refinement had succeeded, the five hundred stone monkey fur would have turned into five hundred group strength Gu.\n\nHowever, after spending large numbers of refinement materials and all the stone monkey fur, Fang Yuan only obtained forty-five in the end.\n\nThis success rate was the result of the group strength Gu recipe already being easy to refine and having a high success rate.\n\nFang Yuan could also naturally use the light of wisdom to improve group strength Gu’s recipe or find substitute materials for stone monkey fur.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan did not have the time to slowly deduce these.\n\nEven if he had time, he might not have the necessary refinement path foundation. After all, this was an ancient Gu recipe and was vastly different to the current systems of refinement path.\n\nEven if had the foundation and time, he had to calculate his expenses and benefits. The deduction process would cost him green grape immortal essence. And he was unable to estimate this amount of green grape immortal essence.\n\nAfter refining group strength Gu, Fang Yuan did not rest, instead he used the light of wisdom to ponder upon his killer move, myriad self. He spent a day of time before he was finally able to perfectly merge the forty five group strength Gu with myriad self.\n\nWhile Fang Yuan was refining, Little Hu Immortal finally completed her assignment, finishing the construction of the blood pool in the western part of Hu Immortal blessed land.\n\nThe blood pool was extremely large, like a lake. In the center of the pool, the six headed snake’s skeleton was bobbing up and down; the intense odor of blood pervaded over a huge surrounding area. There were large numbers of Gu worms in the pool, creating a formation which continually consumed the skeleton to create black blood.\n\nThe core of the Gu formation was the rank five Battle Bone Wheel which Fang Yuan had obtained from northern plains.\n\nHu Immortal blessed land’s time flow was five times faster than the outside world of central continent. Because of this, Fang Yuan was able to make as much preparation as he could when there were only five to six days remaining till the appointed time in northern plains.\n\nTime passed and the day of Hei Lou Lan’s tribulation approached closer and closer.\n\nTai Bai Yun Sheng returned to Hu Immortal Blessed Land through a stargate.\n\nHe brought a pleasant surprise with him."
