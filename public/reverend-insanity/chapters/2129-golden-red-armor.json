The troubles in the sovereign immortal aperture were continuing to increase, unlike Fang Yuan’s previous expectations where he thought the abnormal changes would decrease with time.\n\nWith no choice, Fang Yuan placed many of the variant human alliance’s Gu Immortals inside. With these Gu Immortals working day and night along with himself taking frequent action, they managed to stabilize the unrest in the sovereign immortal aperture for the time being.\n\nMoreover, he still needed to create a suitable combat system.\n\nAnd the most important thing was to become venerable in refinement path!\n\nBecoming a venerable would produce qualitative change.\n\nRefinement path was divided into two major Gu refinement styles: hairy man heaven and earth style and human isolation style. Fang Yuan’s hairy man heaven and earth style had already reached the peak and he could not improve anymore, currently, he was exploring the peak of human isolation style.\n\nHe gained a huge insight from Qing Chou’s style and the accumulate virtue Gu refinement technique of Paradise Earth’s true inheritance.\n\nAnd the Ni clansmen could condense Immortal Gu in their bodies, it was the result of Ni clan Gu Immortal Ni Ren using a human path Gu refinement technique back then. In fact, this was very similar to Red Lotus Demon Venerable’s method of destroying fate Gu and preventing it from emerging again!\n\n“If I can reverse deduce Ni Ren’s Gu refinement technique from Ni clan, I will be able to fill a huge gap in refinement path. Maybe, I can even ascend to refinement path supreme grandmaster!”\n\nThe best situation was if Fang Yuan could ascend to venerable before entering Crazed Demon Cave.\n\nThat would be the most stable.\n\nIf he could not become a refinement path venerable before then, the second best would be to raise his strength to the limits.\n\nOne was to get rid of the problems in the sovereign immortal aperture and annex all the two heavens’ grotto-heavens, reaching the maximum accumulation.\n\nSecond was to form his own combat system.\n\nCrazed Demon Cave was the greatest challenge Fang Yuan would face.\n\nBecause he was not facing just one Immortal Venerable, but several!\n\nCurrently, it looked like there was only Star Constellation, Spectral Soul, Giant Sun, Paradise Earth, and Limitless. But almost all the other venerables had entered Crazed Demon Cave and explored it.\n\nWhen the time arrived, who would decide to jump out would be really uncertain.\n\nEspecially when the River of Time was so chaotic, even if Fang Yuan’s Spring Autumn Cicada was raised to rank eight, it could not be used.\n\nFang Yuan only had one chance!\n\nFinally, Fang Yuan’s gaze moved to the surface of the pillar of silver light.\n\nThe previous clouds represented heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan already knew of it.\n\nBut what was this indistinct projection of a protruding hill?\n\nFang Yuan was not sure.\n\nSouthern Border, Rotten Mud Mountain.\n\n“Nature is really amazing. There are actually qi path Gu materials in this Rotten Mud Mountain!” Feng Tian Yu praised.\n\nThese Gu materials had no value to Ni Jian.\n\nBecause Ni Jian could only recover his strength by increasing his earth path dao marks.\n\nWhat Feng Tian Yu did not know was that these mud containing qi path dao marks were not a natural creation. It was the result of Kong Sheng Tian’s will activating his killer move with the help of Hu Land.\n\nKong Ri Tian, Central Continent’s four great obscenities, and Wang Xiao Er were able to escape because of this. It was unknown where they were now.\n\n“This is strange, this amount of qi path mud is quite a lot. Is there a qi path immortal material buried deep under the ground? How could there be so much qi path mud with no rhyme or reason?”\n\nFeng Tian Yu moved around, feeling increasingly odd.\n\nHe was a refinement path master, and had a lot of knowledge and experience.\n\nHe searched around before finally stopping at one area and ordered Ni Jian to dig.\n\nHowever, even after digging for two days and nights, Feng Tian Yu did not discover any good loot.\n\nAfter Wu clan’s Gu Immortals secretly took away Hu Land, they had naturally cleaned up the scene. Even Gu Immortals would not be able to find out anything from just this qi path mud.\n\nAfter all, qi tides had swept the world before, and qi path Gu materials emerged everywhere.\n\nWestern Desert.\n\nSand Heap blessed land was exposed because of qi tides, and Gu Masters continued to enter and explore it.\n\nHowever, the environment here was extremely treacherous.\n\nWind raged and carried rough sand that cut like knives.\n\nOn the ground, sand waves rose and fell. If one was even a little careless, they would be buried under sand waves tens of feet high.\n\nThe only areas where one could stay in were the sand heaps that appeared inside the sand waves.\n\nThe sand heaps were of all sizes, even the smallest ones were the size of a hill.\n\nThere was space inside the sand heaps, not only was it tranquil, there were also a large number of cultivation resources.\n\nAt this time, inside a sand heap, a group of Gu Masters were surrounding a rank five Gu material. The atmosphere was solemn.\n\n“I saw this wisdom bead grass first.”\n\n“Bullshit! We were clearly the ones who discovered it first.”\n\n“Everyone deserves a share, what is the use in talking about who discovered it first?”\n\nWhile the Gu Masters were arguing, someone suddenly attacked.\n\nThe others were caught unprepared, and the person who got sneak attacked was heavily injured, shouting furiously: “Mo Li, you have such guts, you dared to attack me!”\n\nOther Gu Masters immediately split up and stared at the attacker while also being vigilant of one another.\n\nThis Gu Master was a middle aged bearded man, he was wearing a white scarf on his head, and his triangular eyes let out a sinister light.\n\nHe sneered: “I was most wary of you. Now that you are heavily injured, my greatest obstacle is gone. Hahaha, all of you, die!”\n\nThe Gu Masters were stunned before erupting with fury.\n\n“Mo Li, you have lost your mind!”\n\n“Alright, let me see what ability you have to speak such words.”\n\n“Hehe, you have angered all of us. Everyone, attack together, let’s get rid of this bastard first!”\n\nFacing the group attack, Mo Li felt even more thirst to battle.\n\n“Come, I will let you know my true strength.” His whole body began shining with blue electricity.\n\nHe slowly rose to the air.\n\nThe chaotic and disorderly electric arcs became clear electric threads that covered Mo Li like they were clothes.\n\nThe killer move was activated successfully, Mo Li shouted: “Golden-red armor!”\n\nCrack crack.\n\nPieces of armor floated out from his body, the hundred or so pieces followed the electric circuit and pieced together into one complete armor.\n\nIn an instant, Mo Li was dressed in full-body armor.\n\nThis armor let out metallic light, the golden and red lights emitted a domineering aura.\n\nThe armored Mo Li charged at the Gu Masters like an eagle.\n\nAt first, the Gu Masters attacked wildly, but the golden-red armor did not suffer any damage, there was only some soot left on its surface.\n\nThe Gu Masters were pale with shock as they began to evade and defend.\n\nThe armored Mo Li only charged around like a brute and many Gu Masters immediately died from the collision.\n\nThe remaining Gu Masters lost their will to fight and began to run everywhere.\n\nMo Li laughed coldly inside the armor, he then activated the armor’s killer move.\n\nAt the next moment, the golden-red armor stretched out both hands, a circular marking shone on both his palms before several electric arrows flew out abruptly.\n\nSwoosh swoosh swoosh!\n\nThe electric arrows flew with extreme speed, killing all the fleeing Gu Masters.\n\nThe battlefield became quiet immediately.\n\nMo Li slowly landed on the ground, the golden-red armor separated into pieces and disappeared. After that, the electricity weaved clothing also dissipated slowly.\n\nMo Li half-knelt on the ground, his breathing was rough and his face was sweating profusely.\n\n“Although this golden-red armor has absolute might, the expenditure is too high. In just tens of breaths of time, my primeval essence, stamina, mental energy, and thoughts have been emptied. If not for your complete support, I would have only lasted half the time.” Mo Li mumbled.\n\nPeng Da’s soul floated out: “Don’t we have wisdom bead grass now? We can refine electric brain\\[1\\] Gu with it, with its addition, the consumption of golden-red armor will reduce by more than half and the time it can be maintained will increase by at least double!”\n\n“Yes.” Mo Li smiled and picked up the wisdom bead grass.\n\nAfter Mo Li killed Peng Da and seized his Thieving Heaven true inheritance, he had been cultivating painstakingly. The killer move golden-red armor was his greatest achievement.\n\nWith this killer move, Mo Li’s battle strength was able to surpass rank five Gu Masters for a short period of time.\n\nAnd the reason Peng Da was cooperating with Mo Li was because Mo Li had encountered a life and death crisis before this, if Mo Li died, Peng Da’s soul would also disappear. Mo Li promised Peng Da that as long as he helped, Mo Li would help resurrect Peng Da.\n\nPeng Da and Mo Li reached an agreement.\n\n“Let’s go, we have ransacked this place already.” Mo Li came out of the sand heap and arrived outside.\n\nThe strong wind almost blew him into the sand waves.\n\nMo Li activated his defensive method to endure the devastating sandstorm as he observed the surroundings.\n\nHe could not see other sand heaps and could only sand waves crashing down loudly.\n\nMo Li endured for about seven minutes before he finally saw a new sand heap.\n\n“Such a large sand heap! This is the largest sand heap I have seen! There must be a lot of resources inside.” Mo Li was exulted and was just about to jump into it.\n\nSuddenly, the sand heap exploded.\n\nSeveral figures flew out of it.\n\n“Gu Immortals!” Mo Li’s heart shook, he immediately retreated.\n\nThe Gu Immortals were fighting in the air, their fight seemed to shake heaven and earth, and even dispelled the large sandstorm.\n\n“This is the power of a Gu Immortal, so frightening. Even if I have golden-red armor, I cannot endure the collateral damage of their confrontation.” Mo Li watched secretly, his heart jumped wildly and his mouth was dry.\n\nMo Li observed carefully and gradually saw the actual battle situation — several Gu Immortals were attacking one person.\n\nThis besieged Gu Immortal provoked them while laughing wildly without any worries.\n\nAmidst the chaotic battle, a shadow suddenly intruded.\n\nThis intruding Gu Immortal left shortly afterwards, disappearing in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe Gu Immortal, who was sneak attacked by this figure, roared: “Ling Hu Xu, you dare to steal my Fang clan’s possessions!”\n\nLing Hu Xu laughed loudly: “Who asked you to be the nearest person to me? I didn’t expect you to actually carry so many soul cores. Looks like Fang clan’s plans in green ghost desert were quite successful.”\n\nThe Fang clan Gu Immortal was restless and furious: “Ling Hu Xu, I will advise you to leave those soul cores alone! You are provoking a huge trouble.”\n\n“Haha, will I be intimidated so easily? Goodbye!”\n\n\\[1\\] This has the same characters as computer."
