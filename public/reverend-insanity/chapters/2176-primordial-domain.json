He has already recovered to this degree.” Fairy Ming Hao was shocked.\n\n“Ignore him, use our full strength to stall Fang Yuan, we are about to destroy Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space!” Fairy Yu Xiu reminded.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly, opening his immortal aperture’s entrance.\n\nQi Sea Ancestor flew out.\n\nImmortal killer move — Unlimited Qi Sea!\n\nAt once, vast qi surged, rushing towards him from all directions.\n\nMing Hao and Yu Xiu were intercepted by this move, while Fang Yuan used the chance to dive into the five colored smoke.\n\n“It’s here!” He finally found the location of Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance.\n\nThe five colored smoke had reached it already.\n\nFang Yuan instantly went there and took away the remaining content of Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance.\n\nAt almost the next moment, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space collapsed.\n\n“Quickly leave!” Lu Wei Yin and the rest quickly retreated.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan withdrew the five regional limit formation and became the last person to leave, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space vanished into thin air at almost the same time!\n\n“He succeeded after all.” Fairy Ming Hao sighed.\n\nFairy Yu Xiu smiled: “This true inheritance has been half devastated already, no need to worry, our goal has been achieved in this fight. Let’s go! The crucial part starts now.”\n\nFairy Yu Xiu stored Divine Emperor City, the two immortals vanished instantly.\n\nSeeing this, Fang Yuan revealed an expression of contemplation.\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan.” Lu Wei Yin quickly gathered alongside Zhan Bu Du, Qi Sea Ancestor, and Fang Yuan.\n\nAt the other side, there was Calamity Luck Altar and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun!\n\nBoth sides did not talk, even though they were allies, they both knew about the dependability level of their alliance.\n\n“Four pseudo venerable battle strengths…” Bing Sai Chuan, who was within Calamity Luck Altar, was tongue-tied, in just a short period, Fang Yuan’s strength had grown to such a level.\n\nLongevity Heaven’s Gu Immortals were not fools, the moment Qi Sea Ancestor appeared, they realized he was Fang Yuan’s clone.\n\n“Giant Sun Immortal Venerable…” Fang Yuan looked at Immortal Zombie Giant Sun as he squinted, maintaining silence.\n\nEven though the other party was an immortal zombie now, he still had extraordinary strength and profound methods, the moment he took action, he broke into Divine Emperor City and saved Demon Immortal Qi Jue and Mao Li Qiu, who were sealed inside the painting worlds.\n\nRight now, Mao Li Qiu was curled up in Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s arms, wagging its tail in joy, how could one even imagine that this was a proud legendary immemorial beast?\n\nAs for Demon Immortal Qi Jue, he stood at one side without much embarrassment, his expression was hesitant and suspicious.\n\nHe was saved by Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, but the moment he came out, he saw Longevity Heaven, Heavenly Court, and Fang Yuan in a three-way battle, after that, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space got destroyed, what in the world was happening?\n\nThe scale of the battle was huge, the situation was complex, Demon Immortal Qi Jue could not process it immediately.\n\n“Fang Yuan.” Immortal Zombie Giant Sun nodded at Fang Yuan, taking the initiative to speak: “This is Heavenly Court’s scheme.”\n\nFang Yuan raised his brows: “Oh? How so?”\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun pointed at the place where Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space was destroyed: “According to what I know, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space was added in much later, it was used to salvage the situation. Because it greatly affected Limitless Demon Venerable’s derivation, its destruction is something that Limitless’ will is happy to see.”\n\n“At the same time, Heavenly Court’s Feng Ya is trying to deduce Limitless Demon Venerable’s arrangements, she is also obstructed by this space. Now that it is destroyed, her progress will be smooth sailing.”\n\n“Earlier, when I deduced Limitless’ arrangements, I had fought against her from afar, she is the strongest wisdom path expert among the three pseudo venerables. She has already come into contact with the other core of the ninth layer — Primordial Domain!”\n\n“Heavenly Court came here to obstruct you from getting Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance on the surface, but their true intention was to force me to take action by using the captives in Divine Emperor City as bait.”\n\n“Without my obstruction, seeing that Feng Ya has not shown up even now, it is likely that they have made a breakthrough there. Their advantage and initiative has grown even larger.”\n\nThe moment Immortal Zombie Giant Sun finished his words, Fang Yuan’s expression changed slightly.\n\nThe other immortals’ pupils shrank, along with Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, they all turned towards the direction of Green Lotus Great World.\n\nThe immortals looked past a vast distance, seeing that at the center of Green Lotus Great World, a lump of phantom image appeared at the peak of Book Mountain.\n\nThis phantom image was pure white and humongous, it was far larger than even Book Mountain, having the shape of a ball, with the inner area shining dazzlingly with white light.\n\nThe immortals were all shaken.\n\nLu Wei Yin’s expression turned ugly as he said: “Primordial Domain!”\n\n<<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, chapter five, section thirty-six states —\n\nCarefree Wisdom Heart was born, she was intelligent and witty, Ren Zu liked his eighth child a lot.\n\nBut at the same time, Ren Zu was vexed: “My mind shattered, what do I do? I cannot store more knowledge anymore. Sigh, it seems that only the two of you can help me now.”\n\nThus, Carefree Wisdom Heart and Great Strength True Martial used their own minds to store up more knowledge.\n\nThey filled their minds with knowledge, before moving along with Ren Zu.\n\nRen Zu and his children started their third attempt.\n\nBefore they took a step, they would scatter ink text and knowledge, the text would describe their knowledge and form a small black path.\n\nRen Zu and his children walked on this small path.\n\nBut when they finished using their knowledge and reached the end of the ink text path, they did not see any signs of wisdom Gu.\n\nRen Zu’s third attempt failed again.\n\nGreat Strength True Martial shrugged in disappointment: “What do we do now? We have already done our best, but our knowledge is still insufficient. We cannot hold any more knowledge in our minds.”\n\nRen Zu sighed, he was also quite helpless.\n\nAt this time, hope Gu flew out: “Oh human, don’t be disappointed, I am here.”\n\nRen Zu was surprised: “How can you help me?”\n\nHope Gu answered: “Oh human, I can awaken your aperture\\[1\\].”\n\nHope allowed people to gain enlightenment (awaken their aperture).\n\nThus, hope Gu exerted effort to create an aperture for Ren Zu.\n\nHumility Gu laughed: “Then let me help you as well, human. When you have humility, your capacity will be larger, you will be able to hold more things.”\n\nThus, the aperture expanded in size.\n\nRen Zu obtained the aperture and felt very happy: “This place is really huge, I can store so much knowledge! This is wonderful.”\n\nRen Zu and his children went to Book Mountain again, they refined their knowledge and searched for ink text.\n\nRen Zu stored a lot of knowledge into his aperture, even he did not know the quantity he took.\n\nRen Zu and his children set off on their fourth journey, they stepped on the ink text path and entered deep into Qian Kun Crystal Wall.\n\nThey went very deeply and searched many places, they changed directions countless times but still could not find wisdom Gu.\n\nThey had no choice but to return to Book Mountain.\n\nThis time, because the exploration took too long, the ink text path that they created when they set off was unable to endure the endless barrage of information, a large portion of it faded away.\n\nRen Zu found the inkman elder and asked: “Why can’t we find wisdom Gu?”\n\nThe inkman elder replied: “Sometimes, when we inkmen explore the place, we would encounter wisdom Gu. But you three have searched the entire Qian Kun Crystal Wall but did not find wisdom Gu, it means that it is intentionally hiding from you, it does not want to meet you.”\n\nCarefree Wisdom Heart quickly asked: “Then where is wisdom Gu hiding at?”\n\nThe inkman elder pondered and said: “Oh humans, you have searched the entire Qian Kun Crystal Wall. If wisdom Gu is still inside here, it can only hide in one place. That place is called Primordial Domain, it is the most mysterious part of Qian Kun Crystal Wall.”\n\n“Qian Kun Crystal Wall has a record of everything that happens in the world, it contains infinite information. Primordial Domain contains the information of the world since creation, it also has the information of the ends of all living beings. It is both the starting point and the ending point. It has nothing, yet it comprises everything.”\n\nGreat Strength True Martial was overjoyed: “We have not gone to Primordial Domain yet, oh inkman elder, tell us how to get into the Primordial Domain.”\n\nThe inkman elder shook his head: “It is not that I do not want to help you, but we inkmen have also only heard of the location, we have never entered it. Oh humans, we inkmen admire you a lot. You possess knowledge that far surpasses us, thus, if you want to enter Primordial Domain, you need to rely on yourselves.”\n\nRen Zu and his children had to make their own research.\n\nCarefree Wisdom Heart had a find, she shouted joyfully: “I found it, I found it!”\n\n“Oh daughter, what did you find, why are you so excited?” Ren Zu asked in curiosity.\n\nCarefree Wisdom Heart opened both her palms: “On my right palm, I found right Gu. On my left palm, I found wrong Gu.”\n\n“These two Gu are born in your body, they are ordinary looking and are much less presentable than my authority Gu. What help can they give us?” Great Strength True Martial was very prideful, he spoke nonchalantly.\n\nCarefree Wisdom Heart answered: “These two Gu allow us to differentiate and classify our knowledge. Look at our knowledge again, the truth is, much of it is right at this moment, but after some time, those pieces of information will be wrong. There is also much of it that is right when placed here, but wrong when placed there. I think that if we use the knowledge that is always right at all times and use it to make our text path, we will be able to reach Primordial Domain.”\n\nRen Zu nodded: “Your words are quite logical. Let us try it.”\n\nBut no matter how they looked, they could not find such knowledge.\n\nGreat Strength True Martial’s strong Gu said proudly: “Oh humans, you are wasting your effort. Because in this world, there has only been strong and weak, there has never been right or wrong, thus, your actions are in vain, you cannot classify right and wrong.”\n\n\\[1\\] Awaken aperture in Chinese can also mean enlightenment/reach an understanding."
