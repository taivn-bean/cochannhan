Bitter strength Gu cannot raise his strength limitlessly.”\n\n“Shang clan leader ordered me to not take all-out effort Gu, I can only choose this bitter strength Gu!” Ju Kai Bei’s eyes brightened as he thought of this.\n\nWhether it was all-out effort Gu or bitter strength Gu, they were both extremely attractive to strength path Gu Masters.\n\n“I still haven’t lost! I am at rank four initial stage, I am superior in terms of primeval essence, and I also have my killer move.”\n\nJu Kai Bei possessed plentiful experience and was able to put his disorganized mind in order after pondering for a short period. He was invigorated and his low morale rose up.\n\nThe two began exchanging moves again.\n\nThe battle could not longer be described as intense; desperate was more suitable.\n\nThe two punched and kicked one after another, attacking and defending.\n\nJu Kai Bei’s ivory armor was being broken continuously and while repairing itself. From time to time, he would spurt out mouthfuls of blood.\n\nFang Yuan was also not much better, he was restraining self-reliance Gu which caused his whole body to be full of injuries and blood seeped out continuously, his bones fractured and endless pain continued to assault his mind like tides.\n\nThe heavier the injuries he suffered, the stronger he got. Not long later, he could bring out five beast phantoms.\n\nJu Kai Bei fell into a much more dangerous situation and was almost suppressed to the state where he could not even lift his head.\n\nThis was something he had never experienced at the battle stage.\n\nEven Yan Tu was only his equal.\n\n“Junior, you are too arrogant!” Ju Kai Bei furiously swept his arms.\n\nThree dragon-elephants!\n\nHe suddenly erupted, as the enormous dragon-elephant phantom appeared behind him.\n\nFang Yuan was sent flying.\n\nThree dragon-elephants could suppress five beast phantoms.\n\nFang Yuan’s arms were twisted due to the attack, they were completely fractured. His left arm was even folded into a right angle and the fractured bones were exposed with fresh blood flowing down.\n\nFang Yuan clenched his teeth and endured the pain as he activated self-reliance Gu.\n\nSuch injuries already affected his combat capability and he had to heal it.\n\nHe first healed his right arm before twisting his left arm back to its proper state, forcefully joining the broken parts as he activated the self-reliance Gu.\n\nThe broken bones began to grow again and join together. Then it was the pieces of flesh and finally the skin.\n\nDuring the healing process, Fang Yuan constantly evaded Ju Kai Bei’s attacks using horizontal charge Gu and vertical crash Gu, contending with Ju Kai Bei by doing three tasks at once.\n\nWhen he attacked, he attacked fiercely with a domineering might. But when he dodged, it was a completely different style; he was calm and not flustered in the face of danger, like a slippery loach.\n\nHe used the black stone forest terrain to his maximum advantage, so although Ju Kai Bei’s dragon travel tiger steps Gu was faster than Fang Yuan, he could not catch Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter the healing was finished, Fang Yuan turned around and started attacking again.\n\nTime passed by, the battle situation became more desperate. Fang Yuan’s phantoms gradually rose from five to six then seven until there were eight phantoms!\n\nAt the start of the battle, there were spectators who commented and shouted from time to time, but as the match progressed, the audience had gotten silent.\n\nFang Yuan and Ju Kai Bei’s terrifying strength caused their hearts to feel cold and astonished.\n\n“Too terrifying!”\n\n“Such power, one can only imagine how flourishing the ancient strength path must have been.”\n\n“If it was me, I would have already turned into meat paste no matter which one I fought among them.”\n\n…\n\nThe spectators were speechless but even more secretly felt admiration towards the unyielding spirit of Fang Yuan and Ju Kai Bei. These two were true warriors of steel.\n\nNo one had predicted such a result.\n\nFang Yuan was strong and after he brought out eight phantoms, he was suppressing Ju Kai Bei most of the time.\n\nHowever, Ju Kai Bei was not weak, his healing Gu was also quite outstanding. The combination of dragon guts Gu, dragon travel tiger steps Gu, and dragon-elephant Gu formed a resonance of Dao marks due to their similar law fragments; this greatly raised the probability of bringing out his dragon-elephant phantom.\n\nSweat formed in Shang Xin Ci’s clenched hands.\n\nWei Yang’s frown became deeper and was turning into a knot.\n\nHe could see Fang Yuan was getting exhausted.\n\nEven Fang Yuan’s iron body could not endure unleashing the strength of eight beast phantoms; sweat fell down his body like rain and his muscles were already aching and turning numb.\n\nThere was another even greater danger.\n\nBeing able to simultaneously summon eight phantoms signified his injuries were extremely severe and he was in danger.\n\nFang Yuan was walking on a steel wire, if he was struck by Ju Kai Bei’s three dragon-elephant phantoms, he might die from the attack!\n\nHe was risking his life in battle!\n\nThis was a battle of extremes.\n\nFrom start till now, it had already been over two hours.\n\nThe match gradually reached the climax, the two had reached their limits; their attacks were clearly starting to slow down.\n\nHowever, the match was instead becoming more thrilling and even Bai Ning Bing’s expression was solemn.\n\nThe whole scene was silent, all the spectators were concentrating on the match.\n\nJu Kai Bei finally lost his patience.\n\nHe might be able to strike with three dragon-elephant strength, but it all depended on luck and there was no assurance.\n\nSometimes, the phantoms came out at the wrong timing and Fang Yuan would easily dodge or resist it.\n\n“Why has his primeval essence not been exhausted?”\n\nEven the rank four strength path Gu Master Ju Kai Bei did not have much primeval essence left at this stage.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan, a rank three Gu Master, actually appeared to have abundant primeval essence and was very energetic.\n\n“Could it be, he really has a heavenly essence treasure lotus?” Ju Kai Bei could not help but recall that secret letter sent by Shang Yan Fei.\n\n“If Fang Zheng really has it, his luck is simply too heaven defying!” Ju Kai Bei gritted his teeth, the expected superiority in primeval essence did not exist, causing his fighting spirit to dampen.\n\nBut the truth was, Fang Yuan not only had heavenly essence treasure lotus, but also blood skull Gu and four flavor liquor worm. If Ju Kai Bei knew this, his expression would definitely be spectacular.\n\n“I can’t lose! It seems I can only use my killer move!!” Ju Kai Bei made his decision.\n\nDragon travel tiger steps Gu!\n\nHe suddenly retreated and this unusual movement immediately attracted Fang Yuan’s attention.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan could not catch him.\n\nDragon travel tiger steps was really fast, far surpassing horizontal charge Gu and vertical crash Gu. Even considering this terrain, it was disadvantageous to pursue him.\n\nAlmost instantly, all the spectators gazed at Ju Kai Bei, many realizing something.\n\n“This is bad…” Wei Yang’s expression suddenly changed at this scene and he could not help but cry out in surprise.\n\n“What is it?” Shang Xin Ci immediately looked at him.\n\n“Ju Kai Bei is about to use his killer move! This match has finally reached the climax.” Wei Yang’s voice was deep and sweat seeped out of his forehead.\n\nHe was extremely nervous as he explained hurriedly: “Ju Kai Bei’s killer move has a flaw. If Fang Zheng can grasp this flaw, he could clinch victory! If not, I am afraid Ju Kai Bei will be the winner.”\n\nWei Yang had just finished speaking, when there was a change in the stage.\n\nDjinn heart Gu!\n\nDjinn body Gu!\n\nDjinn mind Gu!\n\nThree rank four Gu were simultaneously activated.\n\nBody, heart, and mind combined; essence, qi, and spirit merged!\n\nJu Kai Bei’s physique suddenly enlarged by three times, a white aura appeared around his body as if signifying the descent of a deity. Along with it, his domineering presence increased greatly.\n\nThis was his killer move — _Djinn transformation!_ It increased the Gu Master’s strength by three times and even his mental energy was raised by three times.\n\nGu Master consumed their mental energy to control Gu worms. If they overused it, their mind would feel sluggishness.\n\nBut Ju Kai Bei’s mental energy was raised now and he became energetic again.\n\nAt the same time, his strength was increased by three times; three dragon-elephant strength became nine dragon-elephant strength!\n\nOnce the nine dragon-elephant phantoms burst out, the eight beast phantoms would be crushed and Fang Yuan would certainly lose.\n\nJu Kai Bei reached his strongest state.\n\nHowever, right at this moment, the ivory armor covering his whole body broke due to his size.\n\nMany defensive Gu could not be stretched with the user and ivory armor was one of them.\n\n“At this moment, he is completely defenseless. His strongest moment is also his weakest! Quick, grab this single opportunity for victory!” Wei Yang’s eyes widened as he mumbled with clenched fists.\n\nAt another corner of the room, Bai Ning Bing’s eyes also suddenly brightened.\n\nAs if he heard Wei Yang’s suggestion, Fang Yuan adopted a posture of attacking, but suddenly his movement stopped.\n\nThe excited and happy look that had just appeared on Wei Yang’s face froze.\n\n“Strike!” He could not help but shout, his heart pulsed rapidly. Unfortunately, the barrier around the stage isolated sound; the spectators nearby casted strange glances at him.\n\nFang Yuan did not move but calmly observed.\n\nThe broken ivory armor was starting to grow, the new armor covered tightly around Ju Kai Bei’s whole body.\n\nFang Yuan’s chance at victory was slipping and becoming indistinct.\n\nWei Yang stomped his feet with anxiety but it was no use.\n\nHe raised his head and heaved a long sigh: ” _Sigh_ , Fang Zheng lost, he lost his only chance…”\n\nFang Yuan did not attack and that was quite a surprise to Ju Kai Bei. He had expected Fang Yuan to attack him, and had already made preparations for that, but Fang Yuan, however, made no such attempt.\n\nIt was a real pity!\n\nBecause, just earlier, he had activated hard qi Gu.\n\nHard qi Gu turned into a ball of formless air covering his whole body. At that moment, he looked like he had no defense, but in truth his defense was extremely tight and solid like a boulder.\n\nHe had covered up his greatest weakness with the hard qi Gu.\n\nIf Fang Yuan had attacked, he was certain to meet with Ju Kai Bei’s frontal assault and was likely going to lose.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan did not move.\n\nJu Kai Bei had even slowed down the regeneration speed of the ivory armor to entice Fang Yuan, but he did not move and quietly watched like a spectator.\n\n“Did he detect it? Impossible. Hard qi Gu is formless. I got it just recently and have never used it before.”\n\n“Hmph, since you are not attacking, then let me make the move.” Bright rays exploded and flashed in Ju Kai Bei’s eyes.\n\nDjinn transformation was a killer move created from using three rank four Gu; whether it was his yellow gold primeval essence or mental energy, they were both decreasing rapidly.\n\nPhysical strength and mental energy were both increased by three times. But at the same time, the consumption was also increased by three times.\n\nJu Kai Bei’s djinn transformation could not be maintained for long.\n\nDragon travel tiger steps!\n\nJu Kai Bei charged at Fang Yuan.\n\nHorizontal charge, vertical crash!\n\nFang Yuan retreated and avoided the attack.\n\nJu Kai Bei was bewildered.\n\nFang Yuan changed his style and suddenly retreated, was it to stall for time?\n\nPointless!\n\n“My body is three times larger now and every step I take is three times as far. With dragon travel tiger steps Gu, my speed is even faster!” Ju Kai Bei scoffed inwardly.\n\nIt was pointless even if Fang Yuan used the black stone forest terrain.\n\nBy now, almost all the black stone pillars were destroyed. Moreover, djinn transformation could completely crush everything in its path; to the current Ju Kai Bei, the terrain was as flat as a pancake!"
