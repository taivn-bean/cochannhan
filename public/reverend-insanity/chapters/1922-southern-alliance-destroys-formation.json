  "content": "1922 Southern Alliance Destroys Formation Myriad Year Flying Warship floated in the sky, Fang Yuan looked at the formation in front of him with a smile.\n\nHe arrived at Yi Tian Mountain again, this time, he would definitely take all of the dream realms away.\n\nThis timing was truly impeccable.\n\nFirstly, Wu Yong had led the Southern Alliance experts to infiltrate Central Continent, Southern Border was at its weakest now. Secondly, the huge battle had just started, this was likely the final period of free time for Fang Yuan.\n\n“Different from the previous life, I had all the initiative this time, I defeated Heavenly Court repeatedly. The secret of my rebirth is known to all, Heavenly Court must have ways to counter it. Their arrangements will be different from the previous life, I should let the four regions’ Gu Immortals strike first while I observe their new methods.”\n\nFang Yuan had a firm grasp of the situation.\n\nAt this point, Fang Yuan’s rebirth advantage was mostly depleted. His previous life’s memories were not reliable against a colossal force like Heavenly Court.\n\nHeavenly Court would not be so stupid as to not make changes.\n\nIf Fang Yuan took the lead as the vanguard, he would be stuck in endless battles, unable to get away from fighting. He might even die in the process.\n\nAfter all, Heavenly Court’s foundation was unfathomable, Fang Yuan could not be sure that the venerable methods in his memories were all the methods left behind.\n\nImmortal killer move — Refinement Formation Rain.\n\nRain started to fall from the sky, gradually infiltrating the formation.\n\nThere were naturally defending Gu Immortals in the formation.\n\nThe Gu Immortals were in panic.\n\nThe formation could not block him, the periphery had already been refined by Fang Yuan.\n\nEven though this formation was set up by Chi Qu You, Fang Yuan had secretly undergone dream realm transactions with him, he gained a lot of information about this formation.\n\nFang Yuan’s formation path and wisdom path attainment, along with refinement formation rain, completely countered this formation.\n\n“This demon Fang Yuan did not attack Central Continent, he came back to Southern Border!”\n\n“What do I do?”\n\n“Seek help?”\n\n“Our rank eight Gu Immortals have all gone to Central Continent under the lead of Lord Wu Yong!”\n\n“We still need to inform them about this!”\n\nThe Southern Border Gu Immortals conversed for a while, nobody dared to go out to fight Fang Yuan, but they had no reinforcements either. They had to use the immortal formation and add changes to it.\n\nThe immortal formation continued to change, Fang Yuan’s speed of refining the formation became slower instantly.\n\nBut Fang Yuan became happy internally.\n\nThe more this formation changed, the more he could comprehend the profundity within it. With the help of the light of wisdom, he could easily understand all of these secrets.\n\nWithin Central Continent, the Southern Alliance’s immortals had already entered the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation.\n\nWu Yong and the rest received this news.\n\n“What? The dream realm was attacked?”\n\n“That scoundrel Fang Yuan!”\n\n“Can he see the big picture at all? He is actually attacking us at this time?!”\n\nThe Southern Alliance’s immortals were furious.\n\nWu Yong was silent for a while before speaking: “Of course he can.”\n\n“What does Lord Wu Yong mean?” Ba De had a livid expression. Fang Yuan’s actions were harming the benefits of all the Southern Border righteous path forces!\n\nEveryone knew about the value of these dream realms, furthermore, they would get more important when the great era arrives.\n\nWu Yong smiled instead: “If Fang Yuan does not see the big picture, he would have attacked the dream realm long ago. He would not wait for us to go to Central Continent. Or maybe, he wants to make use of us as cannon fodder.”\n\n“Then aren’t we sacrificing ourselves for him?” Someone asked in an indignant tone.\n\n“No.” Wu Yong shook his head: “If fate Gu is repaired, its threat will be far greater than the otherworldly demon Fang Yuan. He has been reborn, it seems we took the initiative to attack like now in the previous life. But there is no choice, we need to attack. This is for the sake of the five regions.”\n\n“Everyone, before we left, I already told you that our region would likely get attacked. Be they your family, friends, or our territory, all of the destruction and slaughter pale in comparison to the big picture! If Heavenly Court gains a complete fate Gu, we will all be helpless, there will be no future for anyone!”\n\nWu clan said this as his eyes shined like lightning, he looked around as he declared: “This is my order, let all of the defending Gu Immortals retreat from the formation, do not make unnecessary sacrifices. I know this is a risky move, but even if my Wu clan headquarters get destroyed, I will not retract my words!”\n\nWu Yong’s determination shook the hearts of all the immortals.\n\nThey were all united now, the Southern Alliance immortals were tightly connected, they fought their way into the depths of the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation.\n\nAfter Southern Border received Wu Yong’s orders, the defending Gu Immortals sighed in relief, they brought as many Immortal Gu as they could with them as they started to teleport away.\n\nA moment later, Fang Yuan refined the formation, not a single Southern Border Gu Immortal was in sight.\n\nAfter he dismantled the formation, he received an information path Gu worm, it was a letter that Wu Yong had specially written to him.\n\nFang Yuan’s divine sense swept through it, looking at the content.\n\nThe letter only had one sentence, it spoke of one viewpoint — The threat of Heavenly Court and Fate, Central Continent is strong, while the four regions are weak.\n\nHe did not say anything about asking Fang Yuan to stop.\n\n“This Wu Yong…” Fang Yuan sighed to himself.\n\nEarlier, he was a problem for Fang Yuan, using his political skills to restrict Fang Yuan’s extortion and causing him great loss. But now, Wu Yong asked the Southern Border Gu Immortals to stop defending, he made them retreat and saved Fang Yuan a lot of effort.\n\nIf these Southern Border Gu Immortals continued to defend, it would waste a lot of time.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan takes the dream realm, he would save a lot of time, that meant he could find trouble with the righteous path of Southern Border. Wu Yong’s orders carried lots of risk, it was a bold move.\n\nBut Wu Yong was sure that Fang Yuan knew the big picture, he would not continue causing trouble in Southern Border.\n\nIt was like how Fang Yuan knew Wu Yong would not come back from Central Continent to defend these territories if he attacked.\n\nAnd the truth was, Fang Yuan had no intention to find trouble with Southern Border’s righteous path at this moment.\n\nAfter some effort, Fang Yuan took away all of the dream realms here.\n\nYi Tian Mountain saw the light of day again, the huge Gu Immortal battles engraved here could be seen all around the mountain, there was no sign of life here, everything had changed.\n\nFang Yuan started to head to Central Continent.\n\nAs he traveled, he transformed these dream realms into Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies.\n\nIn the following battle, these Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies would be a huge force of his. In the previous life, Feng Jin Huang was able to resist the detonation of his Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies, in this life, it was likely that she could do the same.\n\nBut Feng Jin Huang was just one single mortal Gu Master. Fang Yuan had the initiative, he had several battlefields to approach.\n\nHeavenly Court, Central Great Hall.\n\nDuke Long, Fairy Zi Wei, and Qin Ding Ling watched over the situation.\n\nOld Man Zheng Yuan was also invited here.\n\n“The latest news, Southern Border’s Gu Immortals broke the first formation, they are going to the second formation. Fang Yuan appeared in Yi Tian Mountain and destroyed the formation, taking all the dream realms.” Fairy Zi Wei suddenly said.\n\nDuke Long said grimly: “Fang Yuan will not continue causing chaos in Southern Border, he will definitely go fight in Central Continent. It seems that we need to deal with these dream realms.”\n\nFairy Zi Wei nodded: “We are very lucky that Feng Jin Huang created the perfect Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique, she can resist Fang Yuan’s dream path methods.”\n\nDuke Long chuckled: “You think this is luck? No, this is the power of fate! Heavenly Court will not lose this battle, we cannot lose.”\n\nAt this moment, Fairy Zi Wei gasped as she showed a surprised expression: “Southern Border’s immortals have broken the second formation, they are going to the third one now.”\n\n“So fast?” Even Qin Ding Ling was shocked.\n\nWithin nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation, the immortals had high morale.\n\n“Chi Qu You, good job.”\n\n“As expected of the sole formation path great grandmaster in Southern Border!”\n\n“With Lord Chi Qu You around, how can any formation stop us? Hahaha.”\n\nJust earlier, when the immortals went into the second sub-formation, Chi Qu You spoke: “Stop.”\n\nNext, he observed the area and led the immortals to quickly and delicately destroy the formation.\n\nThe immortals praised him but Chi Qu You shook his head: “The truth is, I did not see through this formation, I had received information from Fang Yuan.”\n\nThe expressions of the Southern Border immortals froze.\n\nChi Qu You continued: “Using my method, I can break this formation rapidly. But that is a forbidden method that will expend my lifespan. It seems that Fang Yuan had been reborn. In the previous life, he must have broken this formation too, he knows about it clearly.”\n\nThe immortals nodded, agreeing with him.\n\nWhat they did not know was, Chi Qu You was the one who explained the profundity of this formation to Fang Yuan.\n\nIn the previous life, Fang Yuan rushed to Hairy Foot Mountain from Emperor City battlefield, in order to destroy the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation, the immortals wanted to use the five regional limit formation. But without the complete formation chart, and having to create it within the enemy’s formation, it was too difficult.\n\nFang Yuan used his wisdom path and formation path attainment to cooperate with Chi Qu You and Black Extremity, working together to deduce the complete formation chart.\n\nDuring this process, Chi Qu You gave Fang Yuan and Black Extremity an explanation on their experiences of breaking the earlier formations so that they could understand the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation.\n\nSince Wu Yong asked the Southern Border immortals to retreat, displaying greater sincerity and determination, Fang Yuan was returning the favor by guiding them now.\n\nAfter learning of this situation, Wu Yong had a slightly complex expression as he sighed: “It seems that Fang Yuan has already arrived in Central Continent.”\n\nFang Yuan understood Wu Yong, but Wu Yong also understood Fang Yuan.\n\nThe two of them had an indescribable understanding.\n\nEven though they wanted each other to die during normal times!\n\nThe truth was, in the previous life, in order to break the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation, Fang Yuan also asked the Southern Alliance for dream realms.\n\nWu Yong did not hesitate but agreed instantly.\n\nFang Yuan was transported back to Southern Border, the defensive formation was opened and he managed to take the dream realms away.\n\nBut later, when Fang Yuan converted them into Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies, Feng Jin Huang resisted them and he failed to destroy the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation.\n\nUsing Fang Yuan’s guidance, the Southern Alliance’s immortals broke through another two formations, their efficiency was out of this world.\n\nHeavenly Court finally reacted in time, Fairy Zi Wei frowned and thought about the countermeasure when suddenly, rainbow light appeared above Heavenly Court.\n\nBright lights spread everywhere, rank eight Immortal Gu House Calamity Luck Altar shot out from within!\n\n“Heavenly Court, we’re here.” Bing Sai Chuan called out with great morale.\n\n“We have been waiting.” Qin Ding Ling slowly stood up."
