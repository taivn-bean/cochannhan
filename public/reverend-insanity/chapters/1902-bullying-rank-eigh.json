These beasts all had various abilities, his methods were quite wide-ranging.\n\nHowever, even Ren Xiu Ping still felt the difficulty of mid-sized missions.\n\nFang Yuan and the others appeared beside him, causing his heart to jump as he secretly thought: “How could these three suddenly appear at the same time? Is it a coincidence?”\n\nFang Yuan nodded at Ren Xiu Ping and smiled slightly.\n\nRen Xiu Ping was stunned, this unexpected attitude of Fang Yuan made him not know how to respond for a moment.\n\nFang Yuan walked towards him as the obelisk’s words transformed, showing all of its large sized missions.\n\nFang Yuan swept his gaze around it and quickly received one of the missions.\n\nNext, he shared this with Miao Ming Shen and Gui Qi Ye.\n\nWith another flash of light, the three of them vanished on the spot.\n\nRen Xiu Ping watched the entire process, his expression turned grim: “Chu Ying received a different level of mission from me, it is one tier higher. It seems that his merit points fell earlier because he was exchanging for another title to receive higher tier missions. This is very likely to be the title — really good person!”\n\nThe title of ‘good person’ could exchange for mid-sized missions, while ‘really good person’ could exchange for large sized missions.\n\nThis was a simple relationship, the Gu Immortals could easily guess it just by seeing the names.\n\nBut the problem was, so what if they realized it?\n\n“Mid-sized missions are already so hard, large sized missions must be even harder!” Ren Xiu Ping felt gloomy internally: “And why were Miao Ming Shen and Gui Qi Ye able to move together with Chu Ying? Did they receive the same mission?”\n\nThis discovery was quite alluring to Ren Xiu Ping.\n\nMid-sized missions were difficult but if they had help, the difficulty would be shifted.\n\n“Even though the merit points would be divided if many people receive the same missions, as long as we control it well, our efficiency at completing missions will increase, our overall gains will increase instead. Isn’t Chu Ying doing the exact same thing now?”\n\nRen Xiu Ping was a savvy person, after thinking about it, he understood Fang Yuan’s intentions.\n\nFang Yuan did not plan to hide it, in fact, he had purposely released the information.\n\nMiao Ming Shen’s group could be roped in as allies, why couldn’t Ren Xiu Ping?\n\nTheir hatred earlier?\n\nHehe.\n\nHow could hatred compare to the benefits in front of them?\n\nRen Xiu Ping was not crazy, he was astute, thus, there was a chance of cooperation.\n\nRen Xiu Ping definitely had an alliance agreement with Shen clan.\n\nBut it did not matter.\n\nThe Merit Obelisk had such rewards that could eliminate the agreement restraints on a Gu Immortal.\n\nEven without Fang Yuan’s reminder, Ren Xiu Ping must have seen that himself already.\n\nThe second large sized mission was naturally harder than mid-sized missions, but it was no problem for Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter spending some effort, Fang Yuan resolved the big issues and left Miao Ming Shen and Gui Qi Ye to settle the minor problems.\n\nWhen he returned to the Merit Obelisk again, he waited a little while before Hua Die and Feng Jiang returned.\n\nTheir return meant that the first large sized mission was completed.\n\nFang Yuan gained five hundred merit points, while Miao Ming Shen and the rest each gained around eighty points.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the numbers on the merit board as he calculated, this large sized mission gave a total of nine hundred and seventy-three points.\n\nFang Yuan and Miao Ming Shen’s group split up these points, Fang Yuan gained the bulk of them, getting five hundred points was about the same as completing a large sized mission alone.\n\nExcept that he spent way less time and effort on it.\n\nHua Die and Feng Jiang looked at each other, seeing the joy in each other’s eyes.\n\nIn this mission, they helped Fang Yuan resist the waves and settle the minor problems at the end. They only spent some immortal essence, time, and effort, but they gained more than eighty merit points from it.\n\nFeng Jiang thought about the beehive island mission he completed alone, he spent a group of bees, including his desolate beast yellow gyro bee, but only got eighty points in the end.\n\nComparing the two, helping Fang Yuan complete a large sized mission was much easier and reaped greater rewards.\n\n“Go and join with Miao Ming Shen to complete the second mission. I’d advise that we should all exchange for a group title. With a group title, we will be able to communicate with each other.” Fang Yuan suggested.\n\nA group title was not cheap, it required a hundred merit points.\n\nBut Feng Jiang and Hua Die did not hesitate, they listened to Fang Yuan and exchanged for this title.\n\nFang Yuan shared the second mission with them as Feng Jiang and Hua Die teleported to where Miao Ming Shen and Gui Qi Ye were.\n\nFang Yuan received the third large sized mission and went ahead to deal with it.\n\nAfter Miao Ming Shen and the rest completed the second mission and returned to the starting island, the four immortals gained a sum of merit points listed on the merit board.\n\nMiao Ming Shen and Gui Qi Ye also spent merit points to exchange for a group title, it allowed the four immortals to communicate with Fang Yuan constantly.\n\nAt this point, Fang Yuan already completed his arrangements in the new mission, he shared it with Miao Ming Shen and group.\n\nMiao Ming Shen and the rest touched the obelisk and accepted the mission Fang Yuan shared with them.\n\nThey were transported to Fang Yuan, he gave them some instructions before returning to look at the next mission on the Merit Obelisk.\n\nFang Yuan had an advantage in cultivating every path, his value was fully displayed here.\n\nEven for Shen Cong Sheng, many of the missions here were impossible to complete, but Fang Yuan, from his perspective, had methods to solve most missions. What he had to do was to choose those that would give him the most benefits and complete them first.\n\nWith the help of Miao Ming Shen and the others, Fang Yuan saved a lot of time and effort, while they were also gaining much more merit points now due to the help of Fang Yuan.\n\nThe cooperation between them was of mutual benefit, but it was a problem for Ren Xiu Ping and Shen Cong Sheng.\n\nThese people watched as Miao Ming Shen’s group rose in position on the merit board, surpassing them and becoming part of the top rankers, it was truly infuriating but there was nothing they could do.\n\nLooking at Fang Yuan’s merit points, he had reached several thousand! He was truly ahead, far surpassing any other immortal.\n\nBecause of their huge difference, the immortals lost all desire to catch up to him.\n\n“Immortal Gu need at least ten thousand merit points to exchange, Chu Ying is not far away already.” Many people saw this and felt complex emotions, they were in admiration but also felt dejection.\n\n“This is so strange, how can Chu Ying successfully complete so many different types of missions?”\n\n“He must know many secrets about this place, it is a pity that we cannot fight inside here!”\n\n“Miao Ming Shen and his group have truly dog shit luck, how could they gain the help of Chu Ying like this?”\n\nThe immortals were extremely jealous.\n\nShen Cong Sheng sighed, the number of times he had sighed in the last ten days was more than the sum of the previous few years.\n\nThe ranking on the merit board was very glaring, Shen Cong Sheng’s position was even lower than Hua Die and Feng Jiang.\n\nHe was a great rank eight Gu Immortal, he actually was losing to two rank six Gu Immortals, how could he allow this? It was too embarrassing.\n\n“If I can receive a large sized mission, my rank eight strength will be fully utilized, I will definitely gain a lot of merit points. But how can I let others receive the same mission as me?\n\nThe ‘really good person’ title was obvious, but what was the title to share missions?\n\nThey needed to test this.\n\nAnd these experiments would test Shen Cong Sheng’s luck, their merit points would also be wasted.\n\nThis would aggravate their situation from the already terrible situation now.\n\n“I can make my Shen clan Gu Immortals use their merit points, but what about Ren Xiu Ping and Tong Hua? If I do that, will I just push them towards Chu Ying’s side?”\n\nShen Cong Sheng had some reservations.\n\nHe knew that his influence was continuously falling now.\n\nAfter learning that Gu Immortal agreements could be removed using the rewards on the Merit Obelisk, Shen Cong Sheng became more cautious regarding his attitude towards Ren Xiu Ping and others.\n\nFang Yuan and Miao Ming Shen could cooperate to do missions together, he had a good lead.\n\nShen Cong Sheng wanted to copy him, he had to unite Ren Xiu Ping and Tong Hua, these two people cultivated paths that Shen clan lacked.\n\nShen Cong Sheng was already regretting it, he should not have forced Miao Ming Shen and the rest to spend their merit points to exchange for different rewards.\n\nThis action made the immortals go against him mentally, it was a wise action back then, but now it was a terrible idea.\n\nThis was not Shen Cong Sheng’s fault, after all, he did not know anything about the Merit Obelisk earlier.\n\nThe decisions he made back then was very appropriate due to the circumstances.\n\nThere were many types of missions on the merit obelisk, mid-sized missions started to become difficult.\n\nThus, the more paths one cultivated, the more advantage they would have in completing missions.\n\nFang Yuan had already united Miao Ming Shen and the rest, Shen Cong Sheng started to learn from his mistake, he became more gentle in his approach towards Ren Xiu Ping and Tong Hua.\n\nHis rank eight reputation was still around, while Ren Xiu Ping’s alliance agreement was not removed yet, and most importantly, Ren Xiu Ping had a grudge against Chu Ying and Miao Ming Shen.\n\nAll these reasons ensured that Ren Xiu Ping and Tong Hua were still on Shen clan’s side.\n\nWhen Fang Yuan returned to the Merit Obelisk, a new large sized mission appeared — the demonic immortal in regret crying sea has lost his senses, please cooperate with the formation and kill him!\n\n“Regret crying sea appeared?” Fang Yuan was slightly stunned before accepting this mission.\n\nAt this point, four missions regarding the merman city had appeared, but the merman saintess selection competition had not started yet.\n\nThe influence of Fang Yuan’s rebirth had greatly altered the missions on the Merit Obelisk.\n\nWith this mission, Fang Yuan would be able to retrieve regret Gu earlier.\n\nThis was a great thing!\n\nOnce he gets regret Gu, he would be able to advance his Immortal Gu to a higher rank, his progress would be faster than in his previous life."
