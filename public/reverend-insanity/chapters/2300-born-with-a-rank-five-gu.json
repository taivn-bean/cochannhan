  "content": "Chapter 2300: Born with a Rank Five Gu\n\nFang Yuan’s divine sense spread rapidly in the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\n“Maybe I should build some small wisdom path formations so my divine sense can spread here more easily?” Fang Yuan thought.\n\nHis divine sense was moving at a rapid speed but the sovereign immortal aperture was just too big. It was too troublesome for Fang Yuan to look into his immortal aperture closely each time he entered.\n\nOrdinary Gu Immortals had no such issue. Although their immortal aperture was called a small world, it could not compare to Fang Yuan’s sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nNot long after, Fang Yuan’s divine sense reached the destination.\n\nMini Western Desert, Inkman City.\n\nThere was a family at an unassuming corner of the city.\n\nThe man of the family was a young inkman Gu Master, he had limited aptitude and only had rank two cultivation. Currently, he had a nervous expression as he paced outside the room.\n\nWaaaa—!\n\nThe crying of a baby could be heard coming from within the room.\n\nThe man immediately showed an expression of joy.\n\nHe rushed into the room and saw his wife and the female doctor who he had hired at a high price.\n\nThe female doctor was hiding a male inkman baby.\n\nHe was very small and ugly but was healthy.\n\n“Everything is normal, except…” The female doctor smiled at the man and directed her gaze to the baby’s arm.\n\nIn his hands, there were a pair of Gu worms.\n\nThey were bone flesh unity Gu!\n\nThe female doctor had an expression of shock, because she was the doctor here, she saw that this pair of Gu worms were born alongside the baby.\n\n“If I had not been here the entire time, I would not have believed this. Is this… the effect of the Pregnancy Temple?” The female doctor asked the male inkman.\n\nThe male inkman saw this immediately.\n\nHis eyes turned red after seeing the Gu worms.\n\nWith his strength and wealth, he would need to expend a vast amount of time and effort to get such Gu worms.\n\nBut now, this pair of rare Gu worms was born alongside his son!\n\nThis was such a huge surprise.\n\nThe male inkman nodded, he said chokingly: ”Yes, after the Pregnancy Temple was built, my wife and I went to give it a try. To think that it really worked!”\n\nThe female doctor sighed and said: ”You must not be the only one. This Pregnancy Temple really works as they said, it can help you to rapidly have children, and if lucky, they will be born with Gu worms.”\n\nThe male inkman wanted to speak but hesitated.\n\nThe female doctor casted him a gaze of suspicion.\n\nOn the bed, the weak female inkman spoke now, she wanted the doctor to test their bloodline.\n\nThe female doctor was stunned, she realized that they were worried this baby was not their own.\n\nImmediately after, the test was completed.\n\nIt was a joyful ending.\n\n“This is my son, I finally have a son. Oh goodness, I finally have a son!” The male inkman had no hesitation anymore, he held the baby and cried tears of joy.\n\nFang Yuan’s divine sense observed the scene and left quietly.\n\nThis Pregnancy Temple was his arrangement.\n\nThere were many of such mortal Gu Houses, after Fang Yuan built them, he placed them all over the sovereign immortal aperture for the people to use.\n\nPregnancy Temple was a human path Immortal Gu House, the core human path Gu worms it used included: become pregnant Gu, triplet Gu, dead fetus Gu, multiple pregnancy Gu, and safe pregnancy Gu.\n\nIt even used a large number of time path and refinement path Gu worms.\n\nThe actual effect of Pregnancy Temple was to extract the yin-yang qi of the male and female to activate become pregnant Gu and make the female pregnant.\n\nAfter that, it would use triplet Gu to turn the fetus into triplets.\n\nAfter that, two of the fetuses would be used as Gu materials after dead fetus Gu activated, while the final one would be protected by safe pregnancy Gu.\n\nThe two dead fetuses would be refined as bone flesh unity Gu, born together with the final fetus.\n\nThe entire process of the pregnancy to childbirth would not take more than seven days, this was the effect of time path Gu worms.\n\nIn that case, the sovereign immortal aperture’s population would rise rapidly. Once the population went up, more clans would be created, and under the effect of the ’dream path method’, their aptitudes would rise together and produce more Gu Immortal seeds.\n\nThroughout the process, the citizens of the sovereign immortal aperture would feel more admiration and love towards their great leader Fang Yuan, they would feel indebted to him!\n\nIt was clear that they would become increasingly loyal to him.\n\n“The bone flesh unity Gu that comes with the baby act as the vital Gu and is refined naturally. Once these babies are born, they will have a rank five vital Gu. After bone flesh unity Gu reaches a certain level, they will switch to other Gu worms. In that case, the growth of these babies will be accelerated!”\n\nFang Yuan planned inwardly.\n\nIt was not hard for the current him to achieve this, it was completely a breeze.\n\nHe used the human body Gu refinement method, which was one of the peak profundities of refinement path, originating from Ni clan.\n\nWhen Ni clan’s bloodline reach a certain density, the current generation Ni Xiang would be born with an Immortal Gu appearing in their body.\n\nFang Yuan was only producing mortal Gu now.\n\n“When Giant Sun Immortal Venerable created yin-yang path, the essence was in Gu worms like abortion Gu, safe pregnancy Gu, and multiple pregnancy Gu. All the past venerables have comprehended some human path killer moves from <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, but these methods are too profound and not suited for the masses. Thus, Heavenly Court arranged for Divine Emperor City to develop the foundation of human path.”\n\n“The truth is, there is a very special man among the venerables, he had actually created many foundational mortal Gu of human path, but had always kept them to himself and did not popularize them.”\n\n“The prospect and development of human path is truly great.” Fang Yuan sighed.\n\nHigher level human path killer moves were able to easily turn the situation of the fate war around, while lower level methods had incredible use.\n\nFang Yuan was certain that human path was not inferior to heaven path!\n\nMost importantly, human path had not developed yet.\n\n“Human path is suppressed by the Heavenly Dao. Just these human path mortal Gu that are created by Giant Sun Immortal Venerable have such a terrifying effect. How can the Heavenly Dao that emphasizes balance allow such a qualitative change in the growth of humanity?”\n\nFang Yuan was increasingly understanding why Heavenly Court was focusing on developing human path.\n\nHeavenly Court had always been tampering with heaven’s will using fate Gu as their pillar.\n\nAfter fate Gu was destroyed, Heavenly Court became the number one super force that heaven’s will disliked.\n\nBeing unable to use heaven’s will, Heavenly Court decided to develop human path instead.\n\n“But why would Star Constellation Immortal Venerable not know about the weakness of the derivation formation?” Fang Yuan had a deep and eerie gaze.\n\nDerivation formation was situated in Heavenly Court, any research results that it produced would be known by heaven’s will.\n\nThis meant that as those Gu cultivators who entered the derivation formation grew, the Heavenly Dao also grew together with them!\n\nBut even if the Heavenly Dao gained from this, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable still had benefits to gain from using the derivation formation.\n\nShe could develop herself to surpass the other venerables.\n\nIt was possible that in her plan, she would first eliminate the other venerables and make Heavenly Court the dominating force before dealing with heaven’s will.\n\n“Thus, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable has not entered the derivation formation herself, or is she waiting for a chance?” Fang Yuan guessed to himself.\n\nAt least, Fang Yuan knew that Crazed Demon Cave was the most suitable place to put the derivation formation.\n\nThe first seven layers of Crazed Demon Cave could not isolate heaven’s will, but the eighth and ninth layers were safe.\n\nOther than that, Fang Yuan could not see any other possibilities.\n\nIt would not work if one placed the derivation formation into a venerable aperture.\n\nBecause the wild derivation Gu was rank nine, it contained too much heaven’s will. If placed into the venerable’s immortal aperture, the heaven’s will within would connect with the heaven’s will of the five regions, allowing the venerable to be detected by heaven’s will.\n\nFang Yuan had once suffered a loss from this.\n\n“Limitless Demon Venerable created the Crazed Demon formation, but Star Constellation Immortal Venerable must have been a part of it. After all, the formation needs wisdom path’s help. This is also why Star Constellation Immortal Venerable held the initiative in Crazed Demon Cave, after returning to Heavenly Court, she easily created the derivation formation. But Crazed Demon Cave itself must have been made by Limitless Demon Venerable alone. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable does not know of its profundity, otherwise, it will be the first thing she constructs.”\n\nFang Yuan’s divine sense continued to search.\n\nThere were many families in Inkman City that had given birth to children.\n\nThe situation was quite successful, each newborn had a bone flesh unity Gu as their vital Gu.\n\nCome to speak of it, bone flesh unity Gu’s recipe was modified by Fang Yuan.\n\nRank eight wisdom Gu was of some help to Fang Yuan.\n\nDuring this period of time, he easily raised wisdom Gu to rank eight.\n\nIn addition, Refinement Sea and Human Sea were completed.\n\nIt was just that Human Sea lacked Human Mountain, it was not a complete secluded domain now and could still be expended.\n\nThe cost of reviving mortals was much cheaper than Gu Immortals, it could last for a very long time.\n\nOther than Human Sea and Refinement Sea, Fang Yuan had also collected many fragments of the Qian Kun Crystal Wall.\n\nMost of the Qian Kun Crystal Wall fragments scattered in Eastern Sea, Southern Border, and Western Desert were currently in Fang Yuan’s hands.\n\nAs for the other two regions, because of the existence of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, Fang Yuan did not ask about them when he used stealing heavenly secret.\n\nThe complete Qian Kun Crystal Wall was even stronger than stealing heavenly secret, it contained the information of all situations that happened in the world.\n\nIf stealing heavenly secret was said to be a ladle that was drawing water from the vat, then the Qian Kun Crystal Wall was the vat itself!\n\nAccording to Fang Yuan’s understanding after using stealing heavenly secret, the complete Qian Kun Crystal Wall could create Primordial Domain!!\n\nMoving his divine sense, Fang Yuan left Inkman City and came to Mini Eastern Sea to inspect the Floating Refinement Hives.\n\nThese Floating Refinement Hives were arranged appropriately, there were no issues.\n\nThey were originally derived from the Fang Yuan stone nest.\n\nBack then, Fang Yuan had the concept of a production line, he created these stone nests and arranged for many hairy man Gu Masters to refine Gu.\n\nRight now, each of the Floating Refinement Hives were an incomplete secluded domain of heaven and earth, they were far superior to the Fang Yuan stone nest back then.\n\nThere were already many hairy man Gu Masters in some of the Floating Refinement Hives.\n\nThe first batch of Gu worms to refine were relic Gu and connecting heaven Gu.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan’s divine sense looked around for a while, he left again.\n\nAfter a while, under the control of his divine sense, countless Gu worms expended his rich reserves of rank nine immortal essence to activate an immortal killer move — Endless Trouble.\n\nThe core Immortal Gu of this move was rank eight After, it could delay the current calamity or tribulation to the next time, and face them together.\n\nFang Yuan had already modified this killer move and used it many times.\n\nHe adjusted the sovereign immortal aperture’s time flow to make it much faster, this caused calamities and tribulations to occur more frequently, but each time, Fang Yuan used endless trouble killer move to delay them to the next tribulation.\n\nSuch an action infuriated heaven’s will, when the actual tribulation occurs, it would be extremely strong.\n\nFor this was a flaw that Fang Yuan could benefit from.\n\nEven if the tribulations erupted with the anger of heaven’s will and became more powerful, Fang Yuan was confident of passing them and getting a large number of dao marks!"
