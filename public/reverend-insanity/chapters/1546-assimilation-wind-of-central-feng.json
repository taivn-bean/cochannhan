Are they in trouble?”\n\nPrince Feng Xian pondered: “There would be problems for sure, even if we have Lang Ya blessed land’s information and took the initiative, this is still the number one blessed land in the world originating from Long Hair Ancestor, it had unfathomable foundations, they would definitely possess certain trump cards.”\n\nLe Yao frowned even more deeply now: “Central Continent only sent a number of rank seven Gu Immortals into Lang Ya blessed land, isn’t that too… overconfident?”\n\nPrince Feng Xian laughed: “That is because you are unfamiliar with Feng Jiu Ge.”\n\n“Oh?” Le Yao was surprised.\n\nPrince Feng Xian looked afar as he sighed deeply: “I am a person considered to be enormously blessed with talent, I started cultivating when I was thirteen, I became rank four when I was sixteen, I reached rank five peak stage at eighteen. After accepting the sect mission, I went to Northern Plains to develop. After spending three years, I became a rank six Gu Immortal and all my tribulations after that were successful. I roamed Northern Plains and joined Gong tribe, after a hundred years, I became rank eight, even though I was treading on thin ice, who in Northern Plains’ Gu Immortal world could expose my true identity?”\n\n“I had once been extremely prideful and arrogant, because I did not depend on the sect’s support, I worked hard and made use of opportunities and different forces to reach rank eight! Until one day, I met Feng Jiu Ge, I realized I was deeply inferior. Compared to me, he is the true supreme genius, his talent is so great it dominates this entire era!”\n\nLe Yao was extremely astounded.\n\nAmong the higher-ups of Spirit Affinity House, there was the saying of ‘Northern Feng and Central Feng, both soar in the sky as Spirit Affinity’s pride’, they were talking about the rank eight Gu Immortal Prince Feng Xian and the rank seven Gu Immortal Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nSpirit Affinity House knew about Prince Feng Xian’s supreme elder status, they felt that Spirit Affinity House would be in the hands of Feng Jiu Ge and Prince Feng Xian in the future.\n\nThey placed these two on the same level, but Prince Feng Xian was a rank eight with great strength, while Feng Jiu Ge was famous due to his potential.\n\nPlacing a rank seven Gu Immortal on the same level as their rank eight master, Le Yao and Swordmaster You Lan were once indignant about it, even Prince Feng Xian was not happy, he sent a letter and questioned the top supreme elders of Spirit Affinity House.\n\nBut as time passed, Le Yao and Swordmaster You Lan gradually reached a new opinion regarding this matter.\n\nAs for Prince Feng Xian’s change in mentality, it was because he had fought with Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nA number of years ago, when Eighty-Eight True Yang Building had just collapsed, Feng Jiu Ge led the Central Continent Gu Immortals to find out the truth in Northern Plains. As the biggest card of Spirit Affinity House in Northern Plains, Prince Feng Xian secretly met with Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nBecause of this meeting, both of them sparred. The results were shocking, even though Prince Feng Xian did not use his full strength, he only ended with a draw against Feng Jiu Ge!\n\nThinking about that scene where they fought, Prince Feng Xian sighed deeply: “Feng Jiu Ge having rank eight battle strength isn’t the thing that shocked me, what truly moved me was that immortal killer move that he used! This is an unprecedented creation, nobody in history has ever achieved such a feat.”\n\n“What immortal killer move?” Le Yao asked.\n\nPrince Feng Xian had a solemn expression, he said slowly: “Feng Jiu Ge named it — Assimilation Wind Song.”\n\nNorthern Plains, Lang Ya blessed land.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge took a deep breath, separation song was useless, at this point, he only had one method left.\n\nHe would not use this move unless necessary.\n\nBecause once activated, not only would the risks be huge, the process would be dangerous and cause immense damage, there would be reduced gains after battle, Feng Jiu Ge had always used it cautiously.\n\nBut now, he had to admit this, he was forced into a corner.\n\nHe had obtained a lot of intel about Lang Ya blessed land from Fairy Zi Wei. But after fighting, he realized that Lang Ya blessed land’s strength greatly exceeded his expectations!\n\nNot just this super Gu formation, but also those Gu Immortals hidden inside the immortal formation, as well as the killer move complete silence.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge knew that Lang Ya Sect had an immortal killer move that countered sound path, it was called silent world.\n\nBut he did not know that Fang Yuan had specially modified this move into an even stronger version, complete silence!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had defensive methods against silent world, but against complete silence which was many times stronger, he was left without options.\n\nImmortal killer move — Assimilation Wind Song!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge dodged left and right, fighting for an opportunity to use the strongest offensive method that he had ever created in his life.\n\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh!\n\nIntense winds blew, the world went through a transformation!\n\nThis was not golden wind, Luo Po wind, willow wind, immortal wind, profound eerie wind, star galaxy wind, or fan door wind.\n\nOnce this wind appeared, Lang Ya land spirit’s expression changed, the hairy man Gu Immortals were also deeply shocked, while the other variant human Gu Immortals were tongue-tied!\n\nThese were the winds of assimilation!\n\nThe number one wind in the world capable of assimilating everything, few methods could counter it.\n\nWhen immortal apertures were destroyed, this wind would blow.\n\n“How can this be the winds of assimilation? This is impossible!” Some hairy man Gu Immortals lost their composure and screamed.\n\n“Unbelievable, a person can actually control the winds of assimilation?!” Bing Zhuo was so shocked his eyes were about to pop out, his cold demeanor had completely melted.\n\nIn human historical records, nobody had ever been able to manipulate the winds of assimilation personally. But now, this record was broken, Feng Jiu Ge became the first person throughout history to do so!\n\nHe could actually unleash the winds of assimilation!!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had seven songs currently, obtain treasure song and towards heaven song were used to assist his cultivation; green jade song, heaven and earth song, submission song, and separation song were his trump cards that he reserved for major fights. The final one was assimilation wind song, he would not use it unless necessary.\n\nIf he failed to activate this move, Feng Jiu Ge would be the first one to be destroyed by the winds of assimilation, it was extremely vicious.\n\nMany of his songs could be turned into clones through song warrior, but this assimilation wind song could not, it was the most special one!\n\nThis move was too powerful, it turned the battle around instantly.\n\nThe variant human Gu Immortals were helpless, they were flustered.\n\nBecause ordinary methods would be assimilated by the winds of assimilation and turned into fuel to make it even stronger and larger.\n\n“Lang Ya blessed land is the number one blessed land in the world, but against this wind, it will likely be destroyed!” A rockman Gu Immortal said in despair.\n\n“It will not!!” Lang Ya land spirit screamed, he knew he had to stabilize the morale of his side.\n\nHe screamed: “These really are the winds of assimilation, assimilation wind song! I did not believe it when Fang Yuan told me about it, but the truth is in front of me, I need to trust him!”\n\n“Everyone, don’t worry, we have a way to deal with the wind!”\n\n“What? Fang Yuan could even have information about such a secret?” The other Gu Immortals heard this and felt hopeful.\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan, who also had rank eight battle strength, played a crucial role despite being away, he stabilized the morale of Lang Ya land spirit’s forces.\n\nFang Yuan had memories of the future, he knew about the ferocity of this move, during the five regions chaotic war, Feng Jiu Ge had used this move to slaughter countless beings and it was deeply feared, thus he had already told Lang Ya land spirit about it. Even when he fought against Feng Jiu Ge earlier, he was deeply cautious of this move.\n\nThis move was very powerful but it also had major flaws, for example, Fang Yuan could dodge it if he used it in the five regions’ world.\n\nBut in this situation, the winds of assimilation had started blowing in Lang Ya blessed land, the land spirit had to resolve it as soon as possible.\n\nWhat method could actually resist the winds of assimilation?"
