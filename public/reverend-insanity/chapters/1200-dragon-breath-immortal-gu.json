When I have strength like Elder Fang Yuan, the sect contribution points will be solely mine to take!”\n\n“Cheer up, these days will keep on improving, Twelfth Hair, you need to continue working hard and reach your peak in life!”\n\nTwelfth Hair’s mood changed, and his fighting spirit gradually returned.\n\nAs he thought of Fang Yuan, he subconsciously glanced at the first name of Lang Ya Sect’s contribution list.\n\nLast time, because of the four races alliance, Fang Yuan had obtained a thousand sect contribution points which had caused the hairy man Gu Immortals’ mouths to water in envy.\n\nBut recently, because Fang Yuan had issued large numbers of Gu refinement tasks, his sect contribution points had been continuing to dwindle, and quickly at that.\n\nFang Yuan’s name still occupied first on the list, but the gap with the second ranked hairy man Gu Immortal was getting smaller and smaller.\n\nA lot of hairy man Gu Immortals were waiting for the time when Fang Yuan’s name was surpassed.\n\nFang Yuan was a human Gu Immortal possessing rank eight battle strength, surpassing him at the contribution list would give a different sensation to the hairy man Gu Immortals.\n\nIt would be an enormous glory!\n\nHowever, the next moment, Twelfth Hair’s whole body suddenly stiffened.\n\nHe remained still like a stone statue.\n\nBecause he saw the number behind Fang Yuan’s name.\n\n“Over fifteen thousand sect contribution points, how could it be?!” Twelfth Hair almost felt like he was hallucinating.\n\nEver since Lang Ya Sect was established, there had been no one who had obtained so many sect contribution points.\n\nAt most, at one time, Fang Yuan’s sect contribution points had reached above two thousand, before it started rapidly falling.\n\nNow, Fang Yuan’s sect contribution points had passed fifteen thousand!\n\nUnbelievable!\n\nThis was an unprecedented record!\n\nTwelfth Hair’s heart shook wildly, but the following scene made him even more shocked.\n\nFang Yuan’s sect contribution points were continuously rising!\n\nFifteen thousand, eighteen thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand… fifty thousand, sixty thousand…\n\nThe number kept on rising steeply!\n\n“It surpassed… eighty thousand!” Twelfth Hair was stupefied at the sight. What made him even more astonished was that Fang Yuan’s sect contribution points still showed no signs of stopping!\n\nWhen it reached over ninety thousand, suddenly, Fang Yuan’s total sect contribution points decreased by over seventy thousand!\n\nOnly over ten thousand was left now.\n\n“What is happening?”\n\n“Could it be, I actually refined Gu so much that I am starting to hallucinate?”\n\n“This, this is a dream?”\n\n“Ah, no!”\n\nTwelfth Hair suddenly shook and snapped back to awareness.\n\n“Over seventy thousand sect contribution points suddenly disappeared, Fang Yuan definitely exchanged for an Immortal Gu. No, he did not exchange for my beast enslavement Immortal Gu, right?”\n\nTwelfth Hair quickly took out another information path Gu worm and placed his consciousness in it.\n\nAfter inspecting, he let out a heavy breath of relief: “So he did not exchange for beast enslavement Immortal Gu, but a rank seven Immortal Gu. It is good as long as it is not beast enslavement Immortal Gu.”\n\nThat was seriously a huge scare!\n\nTwelfth Hair patted his chest, his whole body easing up.\n\nBut the moment he relaxed, his eyes rolled backwards as he fainted on the spot.\n\nHe had suffered injuries during the Gu refinement process, and his mood had swung up and down at this moment, he naturally would fall unconscious after relaxing.\n\nAchieving his target, Fang Yuan returned to his cloud city.\n\nInside a secret room, he took out a completely new Immortal Gu.\n\nThis Gu resembled light purple colored fog in the form of a dragon, it did not have a fixed shape and was floating around.\n\nRank seven Immortal Gu — Dragon Breath!\n\nFang Yuan had finally chosen sword dragon transformation because Lang Ya Sect’s treasury had this Immortal Gu.\n\nTo exchange for this Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan had to sell all his Gu Immortal souls along with large amounts of cultivation information he had obtained from soul searching.\n\nNaturally, Fang Yuan had withheld some of the contents. Like Dong Fang Chang Fan’s wisdom path methods, Hei Fan true inheritance’s important details, and so on.\n\nThis had sharply raised Fang Yuan’s sect contribution points to above ninety thousand. In the near future, this amount would be Fang Yuan’s peak, difficult to surpass.\n\nThen, Fang Yuan used over seventy thousand sect contribution points to exchange for the rank seven transformation path Immortal Gu, Dragon Breath.\n\nIn just a short while, his sect contribution points had fallen to over ten thousand.\n\nBut he still occupied first place on the contribution list.\n\nThe second ranked Gu Immortal on the contribution list only had four digits in terms of contribution points.\n\nThe gap had been widened by a huge margin.\n\nFang Yuan’s position was firmly in place like a mountain.\n\nNaturally, Fang Yuan did not care about the sect contribution list.\n\nHe also did not know Twelfth Hair had received a great impact from this event and had fallen unconscious.\n\nIf he knew, Fang Yuan would think he was over-thinking it.\n\nNot all Immortal Gu in Lang Ya blessed land could be exchanged. Beast enslavement Immortal Gu was on the exchange list, but Lang Ya land spirit had clearly left it behind for Twelfth Hair.\n\nEven if Fang Yuan wanted to exchange for it, he would not be able to.\n\nBesides this, rank seven Immortal Gu Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus was also not for sale.\n\nThis Immortal Gu was originally Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable’s Immortal Gu, later it was refined by Long Hair Ancestor up to rank eight and was merged into the rank eight Immortal Gu House Refinement Cauldron.\n\nSome time ago, Shadow Sect had invaded Lang Ya blessed land, destroying Refinement Cauldron and seizing many of the core Immortal Gu. Although Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus remained, it had been damaged and had fallen from rank eight to rank seven.\n\nIf Fang Yuan wanted to exchange for this Immortal Gu, he would have to pay a very large price that could move Lang Ya land spirit’s mind.\n\nHowever, Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus would not be of much help to Fang Yuan. He had calculated that after he raised his cultivation to rank seven and his immortal essence started producing red date immortal essence, it would be sufficient.\n\nIt was not worth it to pay a greater price for just Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus.\n\nFang Yuan spent some time before he successfully integrated this rank seven dragon breath Gu into his immortal killer move, sword dragon transformation.\n\nTransformation path immortal killer moves were essentially very simple. Dragon breath Gu was a natural component of sword dragon transformation.\n\nWhat’s more, Fang Yuan was a transformation path grandmaster.\n\nWith this rank seven dragon breath Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan simply did not need any dragon breath mortal Gu.\n\nLike in Hei Fan’s true inheritance, Hei Fan had really wanted to obtain immortal level day Gu and month Gu. Because then, when he activated days pass like years and similar immortal killer moves, he would not need to spend so many mortal day Gu and month Gu.\n\nHaving a relevant Immortal Gu made it extremely convenient.\n\nIt also reduced the difficulty of controlling the killer move.\n\nIts effect would also have a large boost!\n\nTaking a deep breath, Fang Yuan tried sword dragon transformation again.\n\nSilver light burst out, shining towards the sky.\n\nJust looking at this, Fang Yuan knew that sword dragon transformation’s might had increased by multiple times.\n\nFrom within the silvery light, a sword dragon revealed its figure. Its body was more than double the size of before, reaching over forty feet.\n\nIts eyes were still white, its scales were much wider and thicker than before, there were now two more claws, reaching a total of four claws now. The dragon horn protruded out further, piercing towards the sky.\n\nFang Yuan inspected all over and saw that every aspect had received a huge boost in quality.\n\n“After adding the rank seven dragon breath Gu, this is now an ancient desolate beast level sword dragon.” Fang Yuan was well aware.\n\nAs such, this immortal killer move could be used at the blood battle martial competition.\n\nThe previous sword dragon transformation would not work.\n\nIt could only be used to bully some ordinary rank six Gu Immortals.\n\nThe current ancient sword dragon had the qualifications to match against rank seven Gu Immortals.\n\nNext was the most important part.\n\nFang Yuan was unavoidably a little nervous.\n\nHe lightly stretched out his dragon body and flew to a completely new dark inkstone.\n\nDragon breath!\n\nFang Yuan opened his mouth and breathed out.\n\nIn that instant, a pure white sword light flashed past.\n\nCrack, a crisp sound was heard, as the dark inkstone was cut in two.\n\nNot only this, the sword light still had strength remaining to destroy the whole secret room.\n\nFang Yuan’s cloud city shook intensely, giving off muffled noises as large numbers of Gu worms that formed the secret room died instantly.\n\n“I have already controlled my strength, the dark inkstone already bore most of the dragon breath, only a small part of its power was leaked out.” Intense joy flashed past the ancient sword dragon’s eyes.\n\nFang Yuan had only displayed a small portion of his strength, but his surrounding environment actually was unable to endure it.\n\nAlthough the cloud city’s structure was exquisite and hairy man Gu Immortals had spent immense mental effort to make it, it was after all only a mortal Gu house, and could not endure the remaining power of the ancient sword dragon’s breath.\n\nGreen grape immortal essence continued to be consumed to maintain the form of the ancient sword dragon.\n\nClearly, the immortal essence expenditure had increased by many times.\n\nWhere there are gains, there are losses.\n\nAfter all, adding rank seven Immortal Gu dragon breath had increased the level of the immortal killer move, sword dragon transformation, immortal essence being expended rapidly was an inevitable outcome.\n\n“I can no longer practice in the cloud city. Lang Ya blessed land has many observers, but if I go out of Lang Ya blessed land I will receive even more attention from heaven’s will.”\n\n“It seems I still need to place my sovereign immortal aperture and properly test the limits of ancient sword dragon transformation.”\n\n“The dragon breath I send out has already reached rank seven battle strength, its effect is outstanding and the expenditure is still small. How powerful will it be when I use sword marks targeting death, dark assassination and triple layered sword wave in my ancient sword dragon form?”\n\nFang Yuan was feeling anticipation.\n\nHe resolutely took action, immediately flying out of the cloud city, going through the super Gu formation and teleporting to the outside world.\n\n“Fang Yuan has left. He actually exchanged for dragon breath Immortal Gu, what is the reason?” Sixth Hair was secretly activating investigative methods, paying close attention until the super Gu formation activated and Fang Yuan’s figure disappeared from his perception.\n\nAfter Sixth Hair knew the change in the sect contribution points list, he was filled with unease.\n\nFang Yuan’s development speed had surpassed his expectations again. Moreover, he did not understand the direction of Fang Yuan’s growth.\n\n“Fang Yuan naturally won’t exchange for an Immortal Gu that has no use to him. No, I need to report this information to Lord Ying Wu Xie quickly.” Sixth Hair was filled with worries."
