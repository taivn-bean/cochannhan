Even if Fang Yuan advanced to rank eight, how could he have gained so many time path dao marks in such a short period of time? I think he has likely possessed Xia Cha’s body and used familiar face to deceive us and make us think he has already passed the tribulation.” Shang Wu Jie forced himself to calm down and analyzed.\n\n“No! First supreme elder’s Spring and Summer are both rank eight Immortal Gu and can only be activated by rank eight immortal essence.” Xia clan’s second supreme elder Xia Zhao shouted.\n\n“Then…” Shang Wu Jie immediately hesitated.\n\nImmortal essence contained the Gu Immortal’s will and had to belong to themselves, if they died, their heavenly spirit or land spirit could use their immortal essence.\n\nThe only exception was Immortal Gu Houses as immortal essence from any source could be used in them. But the killer moves Fang Yuan used were clearly not Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nIf Fang Yuan was only rank seven with red date immortal essence, he would not be able to activate rank eight Immortal Gu Spring and Summer, even if he possessed Xia Cha’s body and obtained her immortal essence.\n\n“No use in thinking much, we will know after killing Fang Yuan.” Wu Yong called out.\n\nHe flew forward, the immemorial year beast behind him collapsed to the ground, unable to get up.\n\nAt this crucial moment, Wu Yong displayed powerful battle strength, he first killed Fang Yuan’s immemorial year beast and then used all his strength to attack Fang Yuan.\n\n“Fang Yuan!” Wu Yong’s gaze was cold as his battle intent surged wildly, “Even if you have truly advanced to rank eight, you won’t escape your doom today. This five regional mountain range, which you carefully chose, will be your graveyard!”\n\nJust as he finished speaking, the whole mountain range began to tremor violently.\n\nThe ground quaked, the mountains shook, and debris flew everywhere.\n\n“What’s happening?” The immortals were stunned.\n\nWu Yong’s voice traveled to everyone’s ears: “Don’t panic, this is a backup plan I arranged, it can change the alignment of the earth vein under the five regional mountain range and destroy the mountain range!”\n\nThe immortals were even more puzzled.\n\nSo what if the earth vein’s alignment changed?\n\nBut soon, they had a pleasant surprise, as the mountain range gradually crumbled, the five colored lights unique to the five regional mountain range were also rapidly dissipating.\n\n“This?!” Even Jun Shen Guang was astonished.\n\n“Amazing. Without these shackles, our battle strength will recover and we will no longer be restrained!” Southern Border’s Gu Immortals were rejoicing.\n\n“Wu Yong is indeed different from Wu Du Xiu, he still had another card up his sleeve!” Shang Wu Jie’s eyes flickered with sharp lights.\n\n“How can Wu clan be so familiar with five regional mountain range? There cannot be this level of effect just by changing the alignment of the earth vein. They also would have to know the arrangements made by Tao Zhu back then!” Chi Qu You’s thoughts were fluctuating rapidly.\n\nThe large formation, set up by Wu clan’s and Qiao clan’s Gu Immortals in the periphery of the five regional mountain range, was constantly rumbling, it was the source of the change in the entire five regional mountain range.\n\nQiao Si Liu, Wu Yu Bo and some others were in charge of this formation.\n\nWu Yu Bo chuckled coldly while looking towards the battlefield: “This demon Fang Yuan wants to rely on the five regional mountain range, now that we have destroyed his territorial advantage, how will he defend against our Southern Border righteous paths’ attacks?”\n\nQiao Si Liu was silent, her expression was slightly complicated.\n\nShe had once been quite close with ‘Wu Yi Hai’ and had even believed she and he would get married. But the outcome was shocking beyond her imagination. Wu Yi Hai was actually Fang Yuan in disguise. She felt a chill every time she thought of how close she had been with a great demon like Fang Yuan.\n\nShe did not have any feelings left for Fang Yuan, her complicated emotions were because of the five regional mountain range.\n\nEveryone thought Tao Zhu’s research of the regional walls did not succeed. But that was not quite true.\n\nQiao clan had by chance obtained clues to Tao Zhu’s inheritance and had been secretly exploring the clues to excavating the inheritance.\n\nBut they had not expected Wu Yong to know of this information, and under his pressure, Qiao clan had to offer their findings which were then used now.\n\nIt was because of such clues that Wu Yong had a deep understanding of the five regional mountain range and could make the lights of the five regions disappear by changing the earth vein. If it were any other who tried to change the earth vein without knowledge, unless they were extremely lucky, the lights would still exist for the most part.\n\n“Oh! This is a rank eight Gu Immortal’s inheritance, but it is all used up here, and with the destruction of the five regional mountain range, there is no hope in exploring the inheritance anymore.” Qiao Si Liu sighed.\n\nShe seemed to have had many thoughts, but a very short time had passed.\n\nJun Shen Guang’s fright light activated as he was chased by Fang Yuan, the Southern Border immortals attacked Fang Yuan but their attacks were blocked by Fang Yuan who revealed rank eight cultivation, Southern Border immortals conversed rapidly, while Wu Yong made the first move, the five regional mountain range crumbled, removing Fang Yuan’s terrain advantage.\n\nAll these changes happened in an instant.\n\nFang Yuan endured the Southern Border immortals’ attacks while still chasing after Jun Shen Guang even when Wu Yong was nearing him.\n\nJun Shen Guang had used his trump card, his aura had already fallen to an extreme point. His sun deity’s radiance killer move was extremely powerful, but it not only expended a huge amount of white litchi immortal essence, it also permanently decreased his light path dao marks. It was a move that dealt damage to the enemy as well as to himself. Moreover, he had activated it inside the five regional mountain range and had already suffered a powerful backlash. Although he managed to escape for the moment, he was seriously injured.\n\nBut now, the lights of the five regions were rapidly weakening, Jun Shen Guang felt like a huge load was removed from his back, he felt more at ease in his movements as his greatest concern was removed.\n\nLooking at Wu Yong rushing towards Fang Yuan, a thought appeared in Jun Shen Guang’s mind: “Should I cooperate with the Southern Border Gu Immortals to kill Fang Yuan?”\n\nThis thought had just emerged when it was immediately rejected by Jun Shen Guang.\n\n“Continue to escape!”\n\nThe current situation was extremely complex, he was not a Southern Border Gu Immortal. More importantly, Fang Yuan was chasing him, if he managed to escape, it would mean Fang Yuan’s failure.\n\nJun Shen Guang prioritizing his escape was a very wise move.\n\nFang Yuan was still chasing him closely, disregarding Wu Yong.\n\nAt this time, there was another change.\n\nA powerful aura suddenly emerged. Enormous pillars in five colors soared to the skies, a loud voice reverberated throughout the five regional mountain range: “Junior, you did well, you actually passed my final test of destroying the five regional mountain range. Now, my five regions inheritance is yours! Cultivate properly and you can move unrestrained and unhindered over the world in the future, don’t let down my name.”\n\nIn the middle of the five colored light pillars, a smoke-like will condensed into the vivid appearance of a Gu Immortal.\n\nMany gazes were inevitably attracted towards this. Someone recognized this appearance: “This looks like old man Tao Zhu.”\n\n“This can’t be, right?” At the periphery of the mountain range, Qiao Si Liu heard the voice from within the pillars and felt strange: “Tao Zhu’s final test was to destroy the five regional mountain range? This accidental action actually activated Tao Zhu’s inheritance!”\n\nTao Zhu’s will heard someone calling him old man and immediately felt unhappy, speaking arrogantly: “What old man, since you are inheriting my inheritance, how could you be so disrespectful?”\n\nRumble!\n\nWind blew rapidly, heaven and earth roared.\n\nReplying to him was Wu Yong’s rank eight killer move, but it was targeted towards Fang Yuan and not him.\n\nFang Yuan’s immortal robe shook and ripples appeared on it, it was the immortal killer move reverse flow protection seal!\n\nThis move reflected the attack, Wu Yong continued to close in while enduring the reflected attack.\n\nFang Yuan’s speed was immediately restrained.\n\nThe move Wu Yong used had an extremely wide range, so reverse flow protection seal only reflected back a portion that had struck Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan continued to fly while reflecting the attacks back, although he was completely safe, his speed was greatly reduced.\n\nFang Yuan had already used reverse flow protection seal many times, how could Wu Yong not have prepared specific restricting methods?\n\n“What!” Tao Zhu’s will was stunned, he quickly looked around and saw several rank eight Gu Immortals fighting, there were also many rank seven experts present on the scene. He almost broke down from the shock!\n\n“What, what’s going on?” This was completely different from his original expectation, there was no respectful junior in front of him, there were only vicious and fierce Gu Immortals!\n\n“Ignore him, he is just a dead man.”\n\n“The inheritance is here, we can take it after the battle!”\n\n“The urgent thing now is to kill Fang Yuan! Not to mention Tao Zhu’s inheritance, I would even give up a Gu Venerable’s true inheritance to kill Fang Yuan!!”\n\nThe immortals shouted in fury, their attention once again focusing on Fang Yuan’s body.\n\nTao Zhu’s will: “….”\n\nHe was stupefied, this was completely out of his expectations.\n\nShortly afterwards, he shook as he reacted: “Who in the world is that person being chased by so many Gu Immortals? To kill him, they can even give up a Gu Venerable’s true inheritance?”\n\nTao Zhu’s will looked towards Fang Yuan but did not recognize him.\n\n“Who is this person? Someone who became a Gu Immortal after my main body’s death?”\n\nRight at this time, Fang Yuan had finally caught up to Jun Shen Guang.\n\nJun Shen Guang’s whole body was soaked in sweat from the nervousness, intense warning signals caused his heart to beat like a drum!\n\nHe escaped with all his strength while cursing internally: “Wu Yong, you bastard! What killer move did you use, even trapping me?”\n\nWu Yong’s killer move had an extremely wide range, even Jun Shen Guang received its ‘care’. Wu Yong’s exquisite method was not so easily broken, Jun Shen Guang’s strength fell sharply, his speed fell even more than Fang Yuan’s.\n\n“It’s over.” Fang Yuan mumbled lightly as he attacked with no change in his expression, calm like an ancient well.\n\nThe illusory figure of Luo Po Valley in his palm was slowly rotating. Suddenly, Fang Yuan’s fingers clenched it tightly.\n\nA gray light shot out from the gap between the fingers.\n\nFang Yuan then opened his palm and slapped towards the distant Jun Shen Guang.\n\nCOMMENT\n\nThe light shot out with extreme speed, Jun Shen Guang dodged it frantically like a headless housefly.\n\nWu Yong, who was chasing from behind, had a sinister look in his eyes.\n\nA wild wind suddenly blew around Jun Shen Guang, obstructing him heavily.\n\n“Wu Yong, I curse your grandmother!” Jun Shen Guang did not even have time to complete his curse when Fang Yuan’s gray light struck him.\n\nIn an instant, his flight came to an abrupt stop. His physical body had no injuries, but his soul was heavily injured to the point it was almost extinguished!\n\nImmortal killer move — Luo Po Seal!\n\nWhile Jun Shen Guang was in a daze, an Immortal Gu House suddenly appeared beside Fang Yuan. Inside the Immortal Gu House, Ying Wu Xie attacked Jun Shen Guang with a killer move he had prepared for a while.\n\nImmortal killer move — Lead Soul Into Dream!\n\nJun Shen Guang could not react, instantly falling into a dream realm, unable to extricate himself.\n\nThe Immortal Gu House was shadowy and faint, it immediately absorbed Jun Shen Guang and flew to Fang Yuan’s side.\n\nWu Yong paled from fright!\n\nHe had disturbed Jun Shen Guang because he wanted to test the power of Fang Yuan’s move. After all, Jun Shen Guang was not a Southern Border Gu Immortal, why not make use of him once?\n\nBut Wu Yong had never expected Fang Yuan to capture Jun Shen Guang in one move!\n\nPreviously, Fang Yuan had captured the Southern Border immortals by trapping them in a meticulously laid out time path formation. But now, he captured Jun Shen Guang with just a few methods!\n\nSuch an increase in battle strength was simply horrifying.\n\n“What killer move is that, it feels like it only targets the Gu Immortal’s soul? It has such terrifying might, I must defend against it!”\n\n“There is also the Immortal Gu House! What is that Immortal Gu House, it almost cannot be detected when it is concealed!”\n\nSouthern Border’s rank eights rushed over with surging momentum.\n\nBut when they witnessed Fang Yuan capturing Jun Shen Guang, they were shocked and bewildered as their battle intent fell sharply."
