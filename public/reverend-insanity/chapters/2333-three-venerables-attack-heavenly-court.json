Star Constellation Immortal Venerable must have taken action to block most of the force of this explosion.” Several immortals recalled.\n\nNext, they stared with wide eyes as they saw the human shaped qi harvest fruit core.\n\nAlthough the qi harvest fruit exploded, the core was still around!\n\nHowever, despite the qi harvest fruit core having a human shape, it was no longer as lively as before, it was blurry and unstable, with qi path dao marks leaking out at all times.\n\nThe white qi that covered Heavenly Court were produced by the leaking qi path dao marks of the qi harvest fruit core.\n\nRight now, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable displayed the power of a venerable and forcefully pushed these qi path dao marks back into the qi harvest fruit.\n\nBecause of this, the qi harvest fruit core stabilized, its appearance became clearer again.\n\n“We still have a chance!”\n\n“Yes, we can still revive Lord Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable!!”\n\nAfter noticing this, Duke Mei and the rest were excited.\n\nIn just a short period, starlight gathered and turned into a soft stardust cloth, it wrapped around the human shaped qi harvest fruit core like a bandage.\n\nAfter a few breaths of time, there was over a hundred layers of bandage, the core could no longer be seen.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable let out a breath of air as she stopped the killer move.\n\nDrip drop.\n\nAt this time, blood flowed out of her nose.\n\nThe bleeding did not stop, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s face turned increasingly pale.\n\nWhen the qi harvest fruit exploded, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable activated several killer moves.\n\nThe advantage of wisdom path was an abundance of thoughts to allow the user to use more complex killer moves.\n\nJust by looking at this, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was truly the number one person in wisdom path, her status could not be threatened by anyone.\n\nOn one hand, she protected herself and the other Gu Immortals to ensure their safety, on the other hand, she directly suppressed the qi harvest fruit core.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable had blocked most of the force of the explosion, otherwise, Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals would have all perished.\n\nAnd most importantly, she retained some hope.\n\nWithout her, the qi harvest fruit core would have exploded, Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable’s revival would have failed completely.\n\nImmortal killer move — Luck Slicing Golden Blade!\n\nQin Ding Ling chased after Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, she shot out a small golden blade.\n\nThe golden blade was only the size of a thumb, it flew into the air and grew larger as it moved, quickly reaching the size of a horse carriage.\n\nSwish swish swish.\n\nThe golden blade swung down, in an attempt to slice off Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s luck.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable ignored the attack, he only focused on entering Heavenly Court.\n\nThe horse carriage-sized golden blade danced above his head, it was simply like an ant compared to Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s colossal black mountain-like body.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable’s massive luck was reduced by the luck slicing golden blade.\n\nOf course, the effect was insignificant compared to the sheer size of his luck!\n\nQin Ding Ling felt a sense of helplessness.\n\nChe Wei, Red Heart Traveler, and Gu Yue Fang Zheng all had the same feeling.\n\nDespite Demon Judgment Board shooting out beams of blood-red light continuously, it only managed to fracture a few of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s arms, in just a few breaths of time, they recovered completely.\n\nThe difference between rank nine and eight was too massive, even with the full strength of Qin Ding Ling and the others, they could not affect Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nAfter the huge massacre, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable had already recovered by a large extent.\n\nDuring normal times, if Qin Ding Ling and the rest provoked Spectral Soul Demon Venerable like this, he would definitely attack them. But now, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s only goal was Heavenly Court!\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable was filled with heaven’s will, he had once devoured black heaven’s heavenly spirit, so after the two heavens fused, he became the ruler of spectral heaven.\n\nBefore that, he had destroyed the heavenly chasm, heavenly pillars, and the various white heaven grotto-heavens (like Flickering Light grotto-heaven), he even went as far as to destroy the sun, it was all to unify the two heavens.\n\nHeavenly Court was a grotto-heaven situated in immemorial white heaven, it had also annexed countless nine heavens fragments in the past, it was the greatest tumor in the immemorial nine heavens in the first place.\n\nThe existence of Heavenly Court itself was the greatest provocation to Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, he would not allow its existence!\n\nRumble…\n\nWith a loud rumble, the mountain-like Spectral Soul Demon Venerable created a huge gap and broke into Heavenly Court by force.\n\nThe whole of Heavenly Court was shaking!\n\nThe Central Continent Gu Immortals who were still in Heavenly Court looked up and saw Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s colossal body, they all gasped in shock.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable was flying above them now, he cast a huge shadow on everyone.\n\nThousands or even tens of thousands of arms formed a terrifying forest of limbs, they were raised up or lowered, some were tucked in while others were straight, it showed the stance of grasping the sun and moon, it had the potential to catch stars and whip up storms.\n\nQin Ding Ling and the rest chased him from behind like tiny mosquitoes. Even the rank eight Immortal Gu House Demon Judgment Board was merely a mouse in front of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nRoar—!\n\nOne of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s three heads started to roar.\n\nImmortal killer move — Soul Howl!\n\nHe used a soul path killer move, boundless sound waves started to spread.\n\nWherever the sound waves reached, a tornado blew the tiles of Heavenly Court away. Zhao Lian Yun and others felt like a disaster was approaching, many of them quickly took out their Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nAt once, there was a display of Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nScattered Stars Camp, Thin Willow Camp, Wind Sweeping Building, Cloud Passing Building, Sun and Moon Temple, Spirit Affinity House, Myriad Dragon Dock, Heaven’s Envy Manor, Ancient Soul Sect, Heavenly Pool, Illusion Garden, Canary Pavilion, Yue Yang Palace, Immortal Crane Sect…\n\nCentral Continent’s ten great ancient sects all had their own Immortal Gu Houses to defend them, their respective names were derived from their strongest Immortal Gu Houses\\[1. Sect in these names also is read as gate which refers to the Gu Houses being buildings with large gates.\\].\n\nAmong them, Heavenly Lotus Sect was the most unique one, because it was created by Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable, it had a total of five Immortal Gu Houses, the highest among the ten ancient sects.\n\nWhen the Immortal Gu Houses were not in use normally, the respective sects’ first supreme elders would keep them inside their immortal apertures. If the first supreme elders were unavailable, other authoritative experts would undertake the responsibility.\n\nThese people had all basically survived.\n\nImmortal Gu Houses of all shapes and sizes shook intensely from the huge impact of the soul howl sound waves, they were like ships in a storm, about to capsize at any moment.\n\nWithin some of the Immortal Gu Houses, low growling noises could be heard from the Gu Immortals. These Immortal Gu Houses had weak defenses against soul path.\n\nBoom boom boom.\n\nWith a series of explosions, several Gu Immortals’ souls exploded from the force of the sound waves, dying on the spot.\n\nThese Central Continent Gu Immortals were not in their peak condition, they were all injured. Some of the ones with severe injuries survived the earlier explosion but could not endure the soul howl, they lost their lives.\n\nQin Ding Ling and the rest were wavering in the air, being on the brink of life and death.\n\nThey had suffered huge injuries to begin with, they had even taken a risk earlier to quickly destroy Fang Yuan’s totem killer moves, it was already a miracle that they were still alive now!\n\nAt the moment of crisis, starlight shone brightly like the boundless sea, pressing towards Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nThe soul howl stopped at once, it was like someone was strangling Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\n“Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, don’t be too brazen.” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had a cold expression as she flew towards Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable opened his mouth as black smoke gathered, he spat out a grand soul river.\n\nThere were countless vengeful souls in the soul river, they flowed towards Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nAt the same time, his countless arms grabbed towards her, many monstrous claws gathered to firm sharp spear tips that pierced the air, the attack was fast and brutal, shocking deities and devils!\n\nThe starlight only suppressed Spectral Soul Demon Venerable for a few breaths of time before breaking apart.\n\nBut Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not dodge, she snorted coldly as star fog appeared, permeating the black smoke that quickly dissipated, while the fog continued to break apart the soul river.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable’s claws extended into the star fog but failed to catch anything.\n\nEven though he grabbed Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, the latter shattered like a star illusion.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable did not give up, he continued to rampage in the star fog and growled continuously, echoing in the whole of Heavenly Court.\n\nQin Ding Ling and the rest quickly landed on the ground, they hid themselves in the Immortal Gu Houses and used their time to heal.\n\nZhao Lian Yun and the other Central Continent Gu Immortals watched with palpitating hearts.\n\nThe battle of two venerables was too ferocious. The aftermath of any single move could topple Immortal Gu Houses and cause many Gu Immortals inside to die.\n\nThankfully, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had been suppressing Spectral Soul Demon Venerable during the entire fight, she held firm control over the situation.\n\n“This is the might of a Dao Lord!”\n\n“Heavenly Court is still around, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable has a huge amplification when she fights in here, thus, she can easily suppress Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.”\n\n“Of course, the crucial factor is that Spectral Soul Demon Venerable has lost his sanity.”\n\n“Unless the rank nine fire Gu in his body activates, he will not break out of this predicament.”\n\nFang Yuan watched from afar and contacted Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\n“Giant Sun, what are you hesitating for?”\n\n“Primordial Origin’s revival had a hitch, but hope remains. Right now, we must join hands and work with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable to destroy Heavenly Court, it is our best chance!”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable hesitated: ”We should observe further.”\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly: ”If you still want to stall for time, you must have allied with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable secretly. In that case, I won’t be able to stop Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable’s revival. I will fight my way into Northern Plains and slaughter all the Huang Jin tribes.”\n\n“You dare?!”\n\n“Why won’t I? You have Longevity Heaven while Star Constellation has Heavenly Court. If you want to drive me to desperation, will I just give up and die? I will not let either of you off!” Fang Yuan gritted his teeth, showing a look of insanity and desperation.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable snorted coldly: ”Fine, I’ll ally with you, we must destroy the qi harvest fruit core!”\n\nFang Yuan let out a breath of air, praising: ”This is a wise choice, please act quickly, I’ll wait for you to enter the battlefield.”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable gritted his teeth and set off from Northern Plains.\n\nFang Yuan was calm and composed, he slowly rose into spectral heaven from Central Continent.\n\n“Oh no, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Heaven Refining Demon Venerable are approaching Heavenly Court!” Within Heaven Overseeing Tower, a Gu Immortal spoke with a trembling voice, transmitting the information.\n\nAt once, Qin Ding Ling, Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Che Wei, Zhao Lian Yun, Old Lord Can Yang, and the rest had changes in their expressions.\n\nAlthough they had expected this, when it truly happened, they could not help but be flustered and feel fear.\n\n“Three venerables are attacking Heavenly Court at once! Can we… stop them?” The immortals had such a question in their mind."
