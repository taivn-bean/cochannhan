  "content": "Chapter 1114: Obtaining One of Two True Inheritances\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nTime passed quickly, several days went by.\n\nLang Ya blessed land, inside a cloud city.\n\nFang Yuan was sitting in his secret room, cultivating.\n\nUsing connecting heaven Gu, his divine sense communicated with a certain female Gu Immortal’s will in treasure yellow heaven.\n\n“Your pill azure incense is of lower quality than Gu Immortal Xi Zi, the price should be cheaper.” Fang Yuan bargained.\n\nBut that female Gu Immortal was not like Fang Yuan, who used his divine sense to conduct the deal.\n\nShe had left her will in treasure yellow heaven, to manage transactions with goods.\n\nAnd unfortunately, this was a resolute will, it was obstinate in nature, it would not give in.\n\nAs expected, the female immortal rejected with no hesitation at all: “The price is like this, buy it if you want, it is up to you!”\n\nFang Yuan was not giving up yet, he continued: “Will you reconsider? I am buying in bulk.”\n\nThe resolute will was obstinate, it did not agree.\n\nFang Yuan was a little annoyed.\n\nThese last days, when developing the sovereign immortal aperture, he had to trade in treasure yellow heaven, to sell his own resources and buy all sorts of resources.\n\nBut after the third earthly calamity, he felt that his transactions were not going smoothly.\n\nThe female immortal’s resolute will was one of them.\n\nBut this was quite a good situation already.\n\nFang Yuan had been encountering this recently: Gu Immortals would come in and raise prices with ill intent, or he might see some shortage of certain materials, after rank eight Gu Immortal experts bulk purchase everything.\n\n“Even though I have Dog Shit Luck’s protection, in the third earthly calamity, the giant disaster blazing tree destroyed a lot of my good luck.”\n\nThinking about his third earthly calamity, Fang Yuan sighed.\n\n“If I did not think about it carefully and decided to work together with Chu Du before the third earthly calamity, I would have been done for. Even if I passed the tribulation, I would be heavily injured and stuck with bad luck. Currently, I am only facing some small obstacles, they are of no real concern to my cultivation.”\n\nFang Yuan quickly gathered his thoughts, his divine sense continued to negotiate with the female immortal in treasure yellow heaven.\n\nSince she did not agree to lower prices, Fang Yuan could only accept this.\n\n“I will buy your pill azure incense.”\n\nThe female immortal’s resolute will was stunned.\n\nFang Yuan was making a huge purchase.\n\nHe had to pay almost ten thousand immortal essence stones in this deal!\n\nBut Fang Yuan was not shaken.\n\nWith his accumulation from before, he was extremely affluent. Even though the third earthly calamity expended a lot of his green grape immortal essence, he could still afford ten thousand immortal essence stones.\n\nAfter buying the pill azure incense, Fang Yuan retrieved his divine sense, no longer staying in treasure yellow heaven.\n\nAfter inspecting it, he ensured that the pill azure incense had no problems, transporting them into his sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nHis consciousness quickly entered his immortal aperture.\n\nThe sovereign immortal aperture was split into five regions and nine heavens, Fang Yuan placed strength path immortal zombies in all the different areas.\n\nSoon, one strength path immortal zombie flew over under his manipulation, using Gu worms to store the pill azure incense.\n\nThere was no choice, his sovereign immortal aperture was too huge, he could only use these strength path immortal zombies as laborers.\n\nEvery time he was in this situation, Fang Yuan thought of Hu Immortal land spirit and Star Form land spirit, if he had a land spirit, the job could be handled by them, he did not have to waste so much time on this.\n\nThe land spirit was basically the steward of the blessed land.\n\nThey were very convenient to have.\n\nBut it was a pity, Fang Yuan had never heard of any land spirits appearing in an immortal aperture before the Gu Immortal dies.\n\nThis pill azure incense resembled jade smoke, it constantly blew around, creating a hazy area.\n\nFang Yuan placed all of the pill azure incense into Mini Azure Heaven, causing this huge area to become more misty.\n\nEven though the strength path immortal zombie could not smell anything, the pill azure incense was very fragrant, it was very amazing, it had the smell of ink and grass, extremely elegant and long lasting.\n\nAfter placing the pill azure incense, Fang Yuan set up some Gu formations.\n\nThese Gu formations were made with mortal Gu, their only use was to keep the pill azure incense within a certain area, preventing it from dispersing away.\n\n“I accumulated so much now, it is enough to feed change soul Immortal Gu three times.” Fang Yuan was satisfied.\n\nThe pill azure incense would not renew itself, when he used it, it was gone for good.\n\nIf he had to produce pill azure incense himself, it would be troublesome.\n\nPill azure incense grew in places with primeval essence as well as pill crane groups, azure pine forests, ink bamboo forests and herb incense Gu. These four things, including beasts, plants, and Gu, were needed, and each of them had to be of a certain quantity, otherwise they could not produce pill azure incense.\n\nAnd this exact amount was a trade secret.\n\nGu Immortals who sold pill azure incense had a firm grasp of this secret, they prevented the secret from leaking.\n\nAt this point, Fang Yuan could only temporarily store the pill azure incense.\n\nPill azure incense was the food that change soul Immortal Gu ate, but the good thing was, it was widely sold in treasure yellow heaven. Fang Yuan had accumulated a lot of it now, it could last for some time.\n\nAfter more inspections, Fang Yuan modified the Gu formation, he took a final look before leaving, only to see that Mini Azure Heaven had a small area of thick azure spots, it was different from before.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan placed great emphasis on developing his immortal aperture, on the whole, the sovereign immortal aperture was still very barren.\n\nThe point was, the sovereign immortal aperture’s space was simply too big!\n\nFang Yuan placed so many resources inside, if it were the normal aperture of any other Gu Immortal, it would be filled already.\n\nSpeaking of which, Fang Yuan’s sovereign immortal aperture had quite a lot of dao marks, but in influencing such a huge area of space, the dao marks’ effect was very small.\n\nFang Yuan retrieved the divine sense inside Mini Azure Heaven.\n\nThe pill azure incense was already placed, the development of Fang Yuan’s immortal aperture had reached a certain stage.\n\nBefore this, Fang Yuan had already bought several batches of resources, he settled the feeding requirements of Sword Eyebrows, Wave Sword, Flying Sword, and the other rank seven Immortal Gu.\n\n“Rank eight Immortal Gu and rank seven Immortal Gu already have their food. Now, the development of my immortal aperture should be to resolve the feeding requirements of my rank six Immortal Gu.” Fang Yuan assessed.\n\nThe first criteria of development for a Gu Immortal’s immortal aperture was to be self sufficient in feeding one’s own Immortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan was a strength path immortal zombie previously, his immortal aperture was dead, he did not follow this rule.\n\nAfter reviving, he went steadily and surely, settling the feeding requirements of the rank eight and seven Immortal Gu to some degree.\n\nNext were the rank six Immortal Gu.\n\nThere was a need to say, Fang Yuan simply had too many Immortal Gu.\n\nIt was a shocking quantity!\n\nBut there was no choice, Fang Yuan had to raise so many Immortal Gu, not only to resist the tribulations as well as heaven’s will, but also against other Gu Immortals.\n\nFang Yuan’s circumstances were bad.\n\nIn the past, he had Shadow Sect, which concealed him from deductions. But after the battle of Yi Tian Mountain, this protection was gone, Heavenly Court placed his name on the Demon Judgment Board, they were determined to kill him. Northern Plains’ Gu Immortals had deep hatred towards him, because Fang Yuan destroyed Imperial Court blessed land and Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, this was something that created more enmity than digging the graves of these Huang Jin bloodline tribes.\n\nThe other Eastern Sea, Southern Border, and Western Desert Gu Immortals were all after the luck path true inheritance. Even though Fang Yuan did not obtain the true inheritance of all living being’s luck, nobody would believe him if he said it.\n\nAll in all, Fang Yuan’s identity could not be exposed, a lot of Gu Immortals were trying to find him.\n\nEarlier, during the battle of Hei tribe, Hei tribe Gu Immortals had worked with Heavenly Lord Bai Zu to try and ambush Fang Yuan, in the end, because he was vigilant, he did not go to Iron Eagle blessed land and escaped. Of course, Fang Yuan did not know this currently.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan traveled outside using a fake name — Liu Guan Yi.\n\nIf he said his true identity, Chu Du’s attitude might have been completely different!\n\nCurrently, Fang Yuan had worked together with Chu Du.\n\nHalf a month ago, when treasure yellow heaven opened, Fang Yuan received Chu Du’s letter.\n\nIn the letter, Chu Du stated the situation clearly, he informed Fang Yuan that flying sword Immortal Gu had an information path inheritance’s clues!\n\nAt that moment, Fang Yuan was enticed.\n\nEarlier, he was still thinking about the benefits of information path.\n\nWith strong information path methods, he could set agreements with others and not be afraid of them being broken. He could also secretly remove the alliance agreement that was on him, he could easily betray or break his word without any restraints.\n\nHe could even collect intel and make wiser decisions after knowing more details.\n\nInformation path and wisdom path were complementary.\n\nInformation path searched for information, while wisdom path used this information to deduce, they assisted each other.\n\nThe information path inheritance insignia on flying sword Immortal Gu was incredible, even the wisdom path Gu Immortal Tian Xia Xin was interested and wanted it from Chu Du.\n\nChu Du had told Fang Yuan about this situation. He wanted Fang Yuan to know about the value of the true inheritance, so that he could change his mind.\n\nFang Yuan thought about it and decided to deal with Chu Du.\n\nHe agreed to let Chu Du get Reckless Savage’s true meaning, but Chu Du had to compensate him.\n\nAfter the battle of Hei tribe, Chu Du snatched the thirteenth eagle nest under Fang Yuan’s guidance.\n\nDays after that, he and Fang Yuan met in Northern Plains secretly, making a transaction for both sides.\n\nFang Yuan obtained flying sword Immortal Gu and the eagle nest, while lending out calamity beckoning Immortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan could not give the immortal tribulation tempering aperture method to Chu Du. Even though this was an immortal killer move, and Immortal Gu were unique, but Chu Du could use other Immortal Gu in place of these.\n\nDifferent Gu worms could produce similar immortal killer moves after all.\n\nChu Du was a powerful rank seven expert after all, his reputation made him a legendary figure in the current Northern Plains!\n\nWith his help, Fang Yuan successfully passed the third earthly calamity.\n\nIn the first two times, he was gravely injured, the situation was too dangerous. But in this third earthly calamity, he only suffered some setbacks, the biggest problems were resolved by Chu Du.\n\nCalamity beckoning Immortal Gu was simply too incredible.\n\nNo wonder Mo Yao wanted to use this Immortal Gu to help her lover Bo Qing undergo tribulation.\n\nBut eventually, she failed.\n\nCalamity beckoning Immortal Gu was only rank seven, but Bo Qing was undergoing the myriad tribulation that would lead him to rank nine!\n\nFang Yuan did not want to seek the information path true inheritance with clues on flying sword Immortal Gu yet.\n\nThe turbulent flow sea area was a problematic place, it was easy to get lost, and many Gu Immortals often traveled in it.\n\nFang Yuan placed his attention on the eagle nest.\n\nThe thirteenth eagle nest in Iron Eagle blessed land was usually concealed, it only appeared when Iron Eagle blessed land was near the point of breaking apart.\n\nInside this nest, there were clues to Hei Fan’s true inheritance.\n\nFang Yuan had explored it for some time, he had some gains!\n\nCompared to the information path true inheritance, the Hei Fan true inheritance, which could delay the time in his immortal aperture, was far more useful and important.\n\nFang Yuan had decided: While he still had this period of free time after undergoing tribulation, he was going to obtain Hei Fan’s true inheritance!"
