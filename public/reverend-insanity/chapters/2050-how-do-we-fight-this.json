  "content": "Along with his gains, Fang Yuan also paid a hefty price.\n\nMini Southern Border, which was the most prosperous of the five mini regions, was half devastated.\n\nImmortal Succession Mountain was destroyed, washed away entirely by the flood. This mountain was a mid-sized resource point obtained from Hei Fan grotto-heaven, it once had the ability to help mortals ascend to immortal.\n\nThere was also Heaven Sealing Mountain. This mountain was created by Fang Yuan, it was small and unassuming, within the mountain itself, Fang Yuan had once set up a formation to seal his strength path immortal zombie body.\n\nOther than them, there were also up to a hundred mountains and valleys. The greatest losses were Interior Rain Mountain, Copper Seal Mountain, and Bone Bird Peak.\n\nInterior Rain Mountain’s peak was always shrouded by a layer of dark clouds from where light rain continued to fall. The drizzling rain was not ordinary rainwater, but rank six immortal material interior rain! This was a resource point that produced water path immortal materials, now it was in ruins.\n\nCopper Seal Mountain was no longer whole, it used to have a red and squarish shape, it was like a large seal was standing upright in Mini Southern Border. This mountain did not have even a trace of soil, it was completely formed from all kinds of copper.\n\nThere was mortal level copper like chaotic sky copper, pragna copper, snow flower copper, and so on, and immortal copper like profound grey copper and ascending dragon copper.\n\nCopper Seal Mountain was so special, it was heavily targeted by the myriad tribulation myriad destruction lightning forest. Now, half of the mountain was destroyed and charred, giving out dense smoke and sparks. The entire mountain had turned into a molten state, it emitted a terrible smell.\n\nThis mountain once produced domination copper, that was a rank seven immortal material! It was a pity that the tribulation struck, it could no longer produce any.\n\nAs for Bone Bird Peak, it used to have a large number of flower wing white bone birds, filled with vitality. Now, the entire mountain had collapsed too, all of the flower wing white bone birds died from the lightning bolts.\n\nLightning bolts destroyed mountains, floods destroyed forests.\n\nFang Yuan had originally obtained a large amount of musical trees from Hei Fan grotto-heaven, he created Mini Southern Border’s primitive forest using them. After this myriad tribulation, what forest could survive? Not to mention the beautiful qi death birds or the fragrant tea streams.\n\nMini Southern Border was almost completely devastated.\n\nOnly several areas were heavily protected by Fang Yuan.\n\nAmong them were the coiling thread caves, stalactite caves, and the dark inkstone mines. These resource points were all underground, it was easier to preserve them. Furthermore, the rockmen lived in these places.\n\nFire Bird Mountain was an exception, because it was quite isolated, it escaped this disaster.\n\nThis mid-sized resource point had fire path birds of all kinds growing in it. At the top of the volcano were fire phoenixes that were suppressed by the formation. The sunset parasol trees on the mountain absorbed lava as nutrients to grow, branches extended as leaves grew, they gave out the beautiful light of the setting sun, it was an amazing sight to behold.\n\nOther than Mini Southern Border, the other four mini regions were also affected to some extent.\n\nMini Northern Plains’ shallow rock beach was obtained from annexing Han Dong blessed land. It was completely washed away by the floods, all of the pinkish red spirit snakes living in it died.\n\nMini Western Desert’s hound desert was obtained from Liu Yong blessed land. There were more than twenty desolate hounds there, they all died without a corpse remaining.\n\nMini Central Continent and Mini Eastern Sea, even the mini nine heavens were implicated by the myriad tribulation!\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan could not care about it at this point.\n\nMyriad tribulations had taken so many rank eight Gu Immortals’ lives, in the long history of the world, countless geniuses died primarily from them. If he was careless, even Fang Yuan could lose his life!\n\nFang Yuan not only had to deal with the myriad tribulation, he also had to face the three forces chasing after him!!\n\nIf losing some resources meant that he could improve the situation, why wouldn’t Fang Yuan do it?\n\nWhat was more important, his life or these resources?\n\nThe answer was obvious.\n\nOnly by staying alive could he have any hope for the future.\n\nIn fact, even if all of Fang Yuan’s resources were destroyed, even if he lost the sovereign immortal body and his clones, as long as he was alive and got through this predicament, as long as he had one breath remaining, he would accept the result.\n\nThe most important thing was an unyielding spirit, how could mere success and failure determine his life!\n\n“The loss of these resource points is actually helpful to me. The Heavenly Dao seeks balance, with these resource points gone, the myriad tribulation has weakened proportionately. Thus, my efficiency in refining the heaven path dao marks will continue to become higher! Hmm?”\n\nFang Yuan’s expression suddenly changed.\n\nRumble!\n\nWith an intense sound, Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress shook harshly, hundreds and thousands of Gu worms shattered and died.\n\nIt was the move that Demon Immortal Qi Jue had been preparing for a long time!\n\nDemon Immortal Qi Jue!\n\nThis old demon who had resisted Limitless Demon Venerable in history, he had vicious methods capable of weakening and damaging Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress. If he was allowed to continue attacking, he would eventually break through Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress.\n\nIt was not that Lu Wei Yin or the Qi Sea clone did not try to stop him, but Spectral Soul’s continuous attacks hindered them.\n\nSpectral Soul’s body surged with black smoke, he attacked and defended at times, unleashing several immemorial soul beasts while using peculiar soul path killer moves. He not only protected Qi Jue, giving him ample time and opportunity to attack, he even probed illusory sand shifting shadow battlefield even further, he managed to break another layer of this battlefield!\n\n“Lu Wei Yin, Qing Chou, and the Qi Sea clone are attacking Spectral Soul but he is still having an easy time. This current Spectral Soul is also just his remnant soul, he is still injured and has not reached the peak state he was in during the time he refined sovereign immortal fetus Gu.”\n\nFang Yuan sighed internally.\n\nHe could genuinely feel the depth of Spectral Soul’s strength!\n\n“I cannot let this go on, Wu Shuai, go and join the battle, deal with Spectral Soul!” Fang Yuan instructed.\n\nIn this current situation, Spectral Soul and the other two forces wanted Fang Yuan dead. On the other hand, Lu Wei Yin carried on Paradise Earth’s will, he wanted to exterminate Spectral Soul.\n\nFang Yuan was the focus, but Spectral Soul was also crucial.\n\nFang Yuan did not feel great external pressure now, his wariness stemmed from Spectral Soul, he did not hesitate to use all his strength against him.\n\nWu Shuai joined the fight!\n\nAt once, army ants gathered and formed a river of ants, they swept towards Spectral Soul.\n\nSpectral Soul split a portion of his concentration and used killer moves to resist them.\n\nWu Shuai was Fang Yuan’s dragonman clone, he cultivated enslavement path, even though he had not cultivated for long, he inherited the inheritance of the dragonman race, as well as the actual Wu Shuai’s true inheritance.\n\nAfter several rounds of attacks, Lu Wei Yin became hopeful as he thought: “Even though Wu Shuai does not attack often, he has rank eight cultivation level, his battle strength is quite incredible. With him around, we can finally place pressure on Spectral Soul!”\n\nWith him controlling the battlefield, even Qing Chou could join the fight, not to mention Wu Shuai who cooperated with them.\n\nWu Shuai soon mixed in with this group, their tempo became faster as they emitted greater pressure on Spectral Soul.\n\nSpectral Soul was the strongest in the world, but he had not regained his peak strength. Demon Immortal Qi Jue and Qi Sea Ancestor could fight him for over ten rounds even if they could not defeat him.\n\nWith Wu Shuai’s participation, a qualitative change appeared, it tilted the balance of both sides.\n\nLu Wei Yin and the rest attacked unceasingly, their attacks did not stop even once.\n\nSpectral Soul started to get into a passive spot as he resisted their joint attacks.\n\nImmortal killer move — Upper-Lower Breathless Qi!\n\nDemon Immortal Qi Jue stretched out two fingers as he pointed at the top and bottom of Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress.\n\nAt once, Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress became immobilized, Fang Yuan who was inside had a change of expression, he could not breath smoothly. Even worse was that his injection of immortal essence into Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress became choppy and inconsistent.\n\nImmortal Gu Houses required a lot of immortal essence to work. The same applied to Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress, after getting hit by this move, its defenses became much weaker.\n\nA huge flaw in Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress became exposed.\n\nIt was just too slow, it had to resist most killer moves head on. Of course, it had immense defense, it could waste a lot of the enemies’ immortal essence.\n\nThus, Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress was suited for a battle of attrition. Gu Immortals could heal up inside and analyze the enemy’s killer moves while using the defense to waste the enemy’s immortal essence.\n\nPeaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress also lacked offensive methods. The truth was, Demon Immortal Qi Jue could ignore Fang Yuan and help Spectral Soul fight against Lu Wei Yin and the rest. Fang Yuan was currently troubled by the myriad tribulation, Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress was of little threat to them in terms of offense.\n\nImmortal killer move — Soul Explosion!\n\nSpectral Soul suddenly turned around, he endured the attacks of Lu Wei Yin and the rest as he pointed with his fingers, more than ten black dots flew out.\n\nThe black dots shot towards the top of Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress before turning into more than ten immemorial soul beasts.\n\nThese immemorial soul beasts crashed down onto Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress, their mountain-like bodies completely burying the Immortal Gu House.\n\nAt the next moment, boom!\n\nA terrifying explosion killed these immemorial soul beasts on the spot, their sacrifices resulted in this intense explosion resembling a giant black ball.\n\nThe black ball rapidly expanded, in a few breaths of time, it grew to over the size of a hundred li!\n\nThe earth and mountains shook, the entire battlefield started to shake intensely.\n\nLu Wei Yin’s expression changed, he immediately went away to defend the battlefield. If this battlefield broke, even if one corner of it was destroyed, the entire situation would aggravate.\n\n“Spectral Soul is so crafty, he actually had such a terrifying move!” Demon Immortal Qi Jue squinted, retreating to a safe distance: “Soul explosion is not uncommon, it is expected that he would detonate the immemorial soul beasts, but how could he perfectly fuse the detonation of more than ten immemorial soul beasts together like this?”\n\n“Oh no, I wonder how our main body is doing?” Wu Shuai and Qi Sea Ancestor became worried.\n\n“Roar!” Qing Chou was also implicated and got quite injured, the greater the pain, the more maniacal it became.\n\nIt did not care about anything, it attacked Spectral Soul again.\n\nWu Shuai and Qi Sea Ancestor had to follow suit, they could not allow Spectral Soul to absorb Qing Chou’s strength.\n\nAfter using this move, Spectral Soul also turned pale. Against Qing Chou’s assault, he focused on defense while trying to recover. It was evident that the move earlier consumed a huge amount of his mental energy!\n\nIn truth, this soul explosion was very costly. Immemorial soul beasts had rank eight battle strength, Spectral Soul expended more than ten of them at once!\n\n“I wonder how Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress is now?” Demon Immortal Qi Jue approached Fang Yuan.\n\nAs the dust clouds faded away, Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress appeared in everyone’s vision again.\n\nThey saw that this earth path Immortal Gu House was thirty percent shorter, the surface seemed damaged but no holes were created.\n\nDemon Immortal Qi Jue squinted as he sighed internally: “This Immortal Gu House’s defense is likely the highest of all Immortal Gu Houses that currently exist!”\n\nImmortal killer move — Accumulated Soil Mountain!\n\nWithin the Immortal Gu House, Fang Yuan injected immortal essence as he activated the core killer move.\n\nCountless earth path Gu worms flew up in sovereign immortal aperture, entering the Immortal Gu House. After three breaths of time, not only did Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress recover fully, its appearance also changed, instead of being round like before, it became more like a tower now, there were edges and sharp corners.\n\n“This?!” Even someone like Demon Immortal Qi Jue stared at this with wide eyes, he felt a little empty internally.\n\nThis was too shameless.\n\nNot only did Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress have high defense, its recovery speed was also this fast!\n\nIn the current world, most Immortal Gu Houses could not be easily repaired. When replenishing Gu worms, those positions were usually fixed. It was also not as easy as placing Gu worms into these specific positions, there was usually a need to use special Gu worms or killer moves to achieve this.\n\nImmortal Gu Houses were a type of mobile immortal formation, to repair Immortal Gu Houses or immortal formations, one had to consider the influence that these actions would have on the main structure.\n\nBut Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress was different.\n\nLooking at one example.\n\nRepairing other Immortal Gu Houses was like stacking a Jenga tower, the Gu Immortals had to put specific Gu worms into specific holes. During this process, the Gu Immortal had to use methods to stabilize the tower while placing the Gu worms to try to prevent it from toppling.\n\nBut Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress was the opposite, because the core was made of immortal killer moves, no matter how many earth path Gu worms Fang Yuan put in, they could easily merge with the tower and have great stability. In fact, they could even alter the properties of the tower.\n\nDemon Immortal Qi Jue and Spectral Soul spent so long dealing with Peaceful Soil Heavy Mountain Fortress, they had finally gotten some information about it, yet after Fang Yuan’s modifications, the entire fortress was different than before. Spectral Soul and Qi Jue’s probe had to start all over again!\n\n“How do we fight this?” Similar thoughts emerged in the minds of Demon Immortal Qi Jue and Spectral Soul."
