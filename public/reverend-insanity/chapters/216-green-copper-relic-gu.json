Such a change had long attracted the attention and investigations of nearby forces. In these few months, news of Qing Mao mountain being destroyed had gradually spread far.\n\n“I don’t dare to recall, every time I think of it, it feels so painful.” Fang Yuan sat down, his face full of grief.\n\n“Servants, bring the wine.” Seeing Fang Yuan unwilling to speak, Bai clan leader did not pursue the matter, but ordered her servants to bring two vats of wine.\n\nBai Ning Bing was indifferent, she never drank wine, only water.\n\nFang Yuan opened the seal immediately, gulping and drinking a mouthful as his tears fell once again.\n\nBai clan leader was stunned: “Junior, why are you crying again?”\n\n“Your clan’s wine is intoxicating, but it makes me recall our green bamboo wine and of those days when I drank on Qing Mao mountain.” Fang Yuan wiped his tears as he said.\n\nThe clan elders’ sighs became even louder, and many started consoling Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan’s encounter caused them to feel a sense of resonance. After all, Bai clan’s spirit spring was starting to dry out, and if they couldn’t find a new spirit spring, Gu Yue clan’s sorry state would be their Bai clan’s future.\n\nBai clan leader consoled him once more, only then did Fang Yuan stop crying.\n\n“Who would not feel pain when their home is destroyed? I can understand junior’s feelings. But as long as people remain, there is hope. Junior, don’t grieve. I believe that in a few days, you will be reunited with your clansmen.” Bai Mo Xing probed.\n\nFang Yuan acted as if he was unaware, wiping his tears and answering casually: “Yeah, it should be in a few days.”\n\nHearing this reply, Bai Mo Xing and Bai clan leader glanced at each other.\n\nAfter the banquet, Bai clan leader called Bai Mo Xing and entered a secret discussion.\n\n“Clan leader, the situation is bad. Gu Yue village was destroyed, why did these remaining people come to Bai Gu mountain? It is likely that they want to snatch this territory, should we strike first instead?” Bai Mo Xing was worried.\n\n“Hehehe.” Bai clan’s female leader laughed lightly instead.\n\nBai Mo Xing was bewildered: “Why is clan leader laughing?”\n\nThe female clan leader squinted and explained: “Don’t be rash Elder Mo Xing, this situation has boon and bane. As long as we operate this well, we can save much effort.”\n\nBai Mo Xing started to ponder the clan leader’s words deeply.\n\nThat’s right!\n\nBai clan’s spirit spring was running dry after so many years of usage. They needed to find a new spirit spring as soon as possible, and this time they were searching for a suitable spring on Bai Gu mountain under the cover of hunting.\n\nBai clan’s main group had just arrived and could not find anything yet. But if Gu Yue clan’s remnants were coming to Bai Gu mountain, they had to know some intel.\n\nIt could even be deduced that Gu Yue clan definitely held information on that spirit spring.\n\nBai clan leader saw Bai Mo Xing’s expression change and continued: “Looks like you got it. Actually, any large mountain is a gathering of primeval essence, and thus a spirit spring will be there. But to find the spirit spring’s specific location, it is not easy and requires a lot of manpower and resources.”\n\n“There are Fang, Liao and Fan clan around our Bai clan, they are all strong clans with equal power. If the matter about our Bai clan’s spirit spring running dry gets out, they will take advantage of the situation and attack our weakness, thus we decided earlier that we have to secretly find the spirit spring’s location under the guise of a hunting competition. But by doing this, we are greatly restricted and have to expend even greater manpower and resources in searching for the spirit spring.”\n\nBai clan leader was full of worries, but could not express her helplessness.\n\nBai Mo Xing continued: “Thus, clan leader wants to obtain information about the spirit spring from Gu Yue clan?”\n\n“That’s right.” Bai clan leader nodded, her eyes shining brightly: “Gu Yue clan’s leader and elders won’t be easy to deal with, but with those two youngsters in our control? This is a godsend opportunity!”\n\nBai Mo Xing frowned: “But, I see that those two are not stupid. That lass is obviously one of those iron-willed stubborn type, while that young lad, although weak, was unfazed in dangerous situations, being calm at all encounters. The first time we met, even when he was surrounded by us, he did not show a hint of panic. It will not be easy if we want them to divulge information.”\n\nBai clan leader chuckled: “If he did not have such composure, how would he be a clan’s young master? These two young masters are very outstanding, but if they weren’t, I would be doubting their identities.”\n\nBai Mo Xing continued: “Thus, you have to think twice clan leader. If we interrogate them forcefully, they might not submit to us. With the traces they left behind, Gu Yue clan will be here soon. These are the type of desperate people with nothing to lose, except their lives.”\n\nBai clan leader waved her hand: “That is not a worry, clan elder, I have a plan.”\n\n“Oh? This old one shall listen.”\n\nBai clan leader said it softly while Bai Mo Xing’s old eyes kept on getting brighter.\n\nAfter Bai clan leader finished, Bai Mo Xing could not help but praise: “This is a good plan! I saw that Gu Yue Fang Zheng is very attached to his clan, he even cried twice for his clan in the banquet. He is after all a youngster, clan leader, this plan that you came up with is like placing honey in front of a young bear or placing a carrot before a young rabbit. There will be no issues getting him hooked.”\n\n———————————————————————-\n\nFang Yuan opened a corner of the tent’s cover.\n\nIt was night time already, but Bai clan’s temporary camp was well lit.\n\nThe tents were placed perfectly in order, with iron racks and torches at every certain distance, and patrolling gu master groups all night round.\n\n“Young master Fang Zheng, what is the matter?” Fang Yuan had just opened the cover, and the two guards at the door immediately walked over.\n\nFang Yuan burped out some wine: “I drank a lot of wine at the banquet, is there anywhere I can relieve myself?”\n\n“Young master, right this way. You are our esteemed guest, the clan leader has arranged a special spot for you, no further than thirty steps away.” One of the guards immediately said.\n\n“Give me a direction, I do not like anyone near me when i pee.” Fang Yuan rejected.\n\n“I do not dare to disobey young master, the wooden lavatory is right there.” The guard pointed towards it, bowed and left.\n\nFang Yuan got to the wooden lavatory, and after peeing, he pretended to be drowsy and walked in an opposite direction. He was not even twenty steps out when a few patrolling Gu Masters came over: “Esteemed guest, that is the wrong direction, your tent is over there.”\n\n“Is that so? I remembered it was there.” Fang Yuan burped.\n\n“Esteemed guest, this way please.” Bai clan gu masters smiled hypocritically, with a forceful tone.\n\nFang Yuan was brought back to the tent again.\n\nIn the tent, the lights were turned on.\n\nThere were two beds on eastern and western side in the tent. Bai Ning Bing was sitting on her bed and cultivating, using primeval essence to nurture her aperture.\n\nHearing Fang Yuan enter, she opened her eyes, inquiring with her gaze.\n\nFang Yuan glanced at her, before falling down on the bed: “Ning Bing, sleep early. You were exhausted these few days. Don’t worry, we will join up with our clansmen in few days.”\n\nHis words slurred at the end, and eventually he closed his eyes, snoring, evidently falling asleep.\n\nBai Ning Bing’s pupils shrunk. She knew Fang Yuan was acting, purposely saying that as a precaution against any surveillance type Gu worms. He had gone out earlier to pee, but returned so early which meant the area was tightly secured and it was impossible for them to escape quietly in dark.\n\nShe couldn’t help but be worried. Although she was at rank three peak stage, her Gu worms were not optimal, causing her battle strength to be insufficient.\n\nWhile in this camp, Bai clan leader was at rank four, and there are five to six clan elders, and a lot of rank two Gu masters.\n\n” _To be meat on somebody’s chopping board._ ” That was the current situation. Although Bai clan was a righteous faction, people die for fortune and birds die for food, once the benefits exceeded the risk, they would definitely commit murder in secret.\n\nBai Ning Bing knew the Gu worms in Fang Yuan’s possession were all extremely rare. Heavenly essence treasure lotus, blood skull Gu, once exposed, would definitely attract the greed of Bai clan Gu Masters.\n\nThe reason they did not act yet was because Fang Yuan used the threat of the non existent Gu Yue clansmen to temporarily lie to them.\n\nA few days later, when they do not see Gu Yue clansmen arrive, they would be suspicious. By then, Fang Yuan and her would be at a tight spot.\n\n“How do I get out of this predicament?” Bai Ning Bing frowned, staring at Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan had already turned around, his back facing her, and he seemed to have really slept from the sound of his relaxed breathing.\n\n“You sure take it easy!” Bai Ning Bing snorted, feeling anxious and helpless in her heart.\n\n————————————————————–\n\nThe next day. It was a bright sunny day.\n\nThere were three loud drum beats which signified the Bai clan leader summoning the clansmen.\n\n“Our Bai clan annual hunting competition starts from today and will continue for the next seven days, it is time for you to display your strength. According to our rules, those who get a decent ranking will be heavily rewarded! Next, feel free to display all your bravery and strength.”\n\nBai clan leader waved her hand, and the village gates opened. The Gu Masters were eager to start the competition, rushing out impatiently.\n\nNot long later, they entered the forest from their respective positions, vanishing into the wilderness.\n\nThe crowded camp had become more spacious and empty.\n\n“Junior Fang Zheng, did you sleep well last night?” Bai clan leader turned around, asking Fang Yuan with a smile.\n\nFang Yuan cupped his fist: “Thank you clan leader for the hospitality. Last night I fell asleep immediately after lying down, and it was morning already when I woke up.”\n\n“Hahaha.” Bai clan leader smiled, patting Fang Yuan’s shoulders, giving off a kind and affectionate feeling: “Does junior want to enter our clan’s hunting competition? Let us see the valor of a Gu Yue clansman!”\n\nFang Yuan showed a difficult expression, rejecting: “I am ashamed! Junior was heavily injured not too long ago, and my cultivation fell from rank three. Thankfully I was saved by the clan, but now I only have rank one middle stage cultivation.”\n\nEven without Fang Yuan mentioning it, his rank one aura was clear to the eyes.\n\n“No worries junior. As our clan’s esteemed guest, you will definitely be well treated. How about this, as long as junior can hunt an adult black bear, this green copper relic Gu will be your reward.” Bai clan leader clapped her hand, and a Gu Master beside her opened his palm, as a finger-sized round ball shaped Gu emerged.\n\nFang Yuan laughed coldly in his heart, but showed an earnest expression: “Then this junior shall take up the invitation!”"
