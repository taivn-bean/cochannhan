This caused the blood tide to burst out and flood the surrounding area, causing this huge disaster.\n\nRong Hao had a worried expression: “It will not be easy for the two of us to create a new Gu formation and seal the blood tide again. If we had another rank six, with three Gu Immortals, we would barely be able to do it.”\n\nThese two had rank six cultivation level, it was not difficult to handle this blood tide disaster, but Wu Yong gave them a limited amount of time. Two people were not able to resolve this in a short period of time.\n\nThere was no choice, Wu Yong could not deploy more people to handle this troublesome situation.\n\nDuring Wu Du Xiu’s era, Wu clan rapidly expanded without obstruction, because Wu Du Xiu could suppress the entire situation alone.\n\nOnce Wu Du Xiu died, Wu Yong took over, Wu clan only had one rank eight left, even though Wu Yong had great capabilities, Wu clan’s territory was just too big.\n\nDue to Purple Mountain True Monarch’s scheme, the super forces could not control their desires, Wu clan was faced with obstacles created by many of the super forces.\n\nWu Yong stayed in their headquarters and was maintaining the situation and deciding on who to send.\n\nBut this time, Wu Yi Ran had died, with him gone, a huge gap formed instantly in Wu clan’s defense line.\n\nSending out Wu Yuan Ju and Rong Hao was already Wu clan’s limit.\n\n“Give it our all, even if we exceed the time limit, we have already tried our best.” Wu Yuan Ju sighed, starting to act.\n\nRong Hao cooperated.\n\nHe was not a Wu clansman, he was an external supreme elder recruited by Wu clan.\n\nSouthern Border’s clans were very unwelcoming to outsiders, it was not easy for Wu clan to break tradition and recruit an external Gu Immortal into Wu clan.\n\nUnder the two Gu Immortals’ methods, the blood tide continued to push backwards, the blood tide pit was like a huge monstrous mouth, devouring the blood outside.\n\nThe situation was under control.\n\nIt was getting better.\n\nWu Yuan Ju sighed: “After suppressing this blood tide and rebuilding the Gu formation, Rong Hao, you will have to take over the position of guarding this place. I hope you can be careful, the situation is quite tense now.”\n\nRong Hao nodded:”I understand. I heard that this blood tide pit was not naturally formed, it was created by Blood Sea Ancestor on purpose?”\n\nWu Yuan Ju nodded: “Blood Sea Ancestor left behind seven true inheritances, this is one of the seven true inheritances that he had meticulously arranged. It was not eye-catching earlier, similar to normal pits, but when a Gu Master from Shang clan entered, he obtained a Blood Sea true inheritance, obtaining blood handprint Gu. This person is Shang clan’s previous clan leader, Shang Yan Fei, he had died on Yi Tian Mountain.”\n\nAfter Shang Yan Fei took away the Blood Sea true inheritance, blood tides started to appear in this pit unceasingly.\n\nWu Du Xiu sent Gu Immortals here and made this part of Wu clan’s territory.\n\nDue to Wu clan’s management, blood tide pit quickly became a blood path resource point. Wu clan was developing blood path, this resource point made great contributions.\n\n“You two sure are happy.” At this time, Rong Hao heard a voice in his mind.\n\n“Who?!” Rong Hao was shocked.\n\nHe wanted to use his methods to defend himself, but he could not move at all.\n\nHe quickly looked over at Wu Yuan Ju to seek help, but he was soon met with despair, as Wu Yuan Ju was also immobilized, in the same state as him.\n\nA small figure had appeared on Rong Hao’s shoulder.\n\nHe was the size of a thumb, he had wings on his back, resembling dragonfly wings, his purple hair was very eye catching.\n\nIt was none other than rank eight wisdom path Gu Immortal Purple Mountain True Monarch!\n\n“Miniman Gu Immortal?” Wu Yuan Ju was shocked, but he quickly calmed down, Purple Mountain True Monarch’s aura was concealed, he did not expose his rank eight aura.\n\nRong Hao quickly added: “As a variant human, you must know that humans are the rulers of the world. No matter who instigated you, I hope that you will not act rashly. Because we are not only human Gu Immortals, we are also members of Wu clan. Wu clan is the number one righteous path force in Southern Border, if you kill us, the consequences will be severe.”\n\n“We have no grudges between us. We of Wu clan would not bully people, if you have any requests, we can help you with them, we can become friends.” Wu Yuan Ju continued.\n\nHe had great chemistry with Rong Hao, both threatening and urging at the same time.\n\nBut before he finished his words, he started to stutter as his gaze turned hollow.\n\nRong Hao was shocked, he blurted out: “Wisdom path Gu Immortal?!”\n\nAt this point, he also became incoherent.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch’s wisdom path methods interfered with Wu Yuan Ju’s and Rong Hao’s thoughts, they could not even think and speak now, they were completely defenseless.\n\nWhen Gu Immortals manipulate Gu worms, thoughts were needed, their body actions also needed thoughts to act.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch directly interfered with their thoughts, controlling them from this aspect, these two rank six Gu Immortals had no way of resisting him.\n\nEasily controlling the situation, Purple Mountain True Monarch looked at the blood tide pit and smiled.\n\nNext, his rank eight aura burst out, in the blink of an eye, it engulfed the surroundings.\n\nThe blood tide below his feet became calmer.\n\nAfter some time, Purple Mountain True Monarch opened his mouth, letting out a breath.\n\nHis breath floated into the blood tide pit, it was not eye catching, quickly devoured by the rushing blood tide, vanishing.\n\nAt this point, Purple Mountain True Monarch turned around, looking afar and saying: “Your turn.”\n\nLight in seven colors appeared as a voice said in a trembling tone: “You are a rank eight great expert! With your strength, you can move unhindered in Southern Border, why must you find trouble with a minor character like me?”\n\n“I have my own plans. You have to pay for what you owe. When you inherited Seven Illusions true inheritance, you should have expected this day.” Purple Mountain True Monarch said.\n\n“But the inheritors before me have never received any orders. Why me?” The mysterious Gu Immortal covered in rainbow lights said in a reluctant tone.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch sighed, looking at Heavenly Court: “Maybe this is your fate. Alright, use Qiao Zhi Cai’s method to kill this person.”\n\nWu Yuan Ju and Rong Hao were still dazed, unable to move.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch captured these two alive, but he still wanted the mysterious Gu Immortal to kill them.\n\nThe mysterious Gu Immortal did not dare to disobey Purple Mountain True Monarch, he used his profound light, as it transformed and landed on these two Wu clan Gu Immortals, destroying their souls, and even their bodies turning into wooden statues.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch released control on them, as these two statues fell into the blood tide.\n\n“Let’s go.” Purple Mountain True Monarch said plainly.\n\nHow could the mysterious Gu Immortal defy Purple Mountain True Monarch? Even if he was not a rank eight great expert, with just the information path alliance agreement in the true inheritance, it could restrict the mysterious Gu Immortal.\n\nBoth of them left as quickly as they came.\n\nOf course, Purple Mountain True Monarch did not forget to clean up his traces in the battlefield.\n\nA moment later, intense winds blew in the air, countless clouds were scattered, clear skies could be seen everywhere.\n\nA grand and vast rank eight aura enveloped the area.\n\nWu Yong’s expression was of rage, his eyes were slightly red as he descended.\n\nWho was it?\n\nWho had killed them?!\n\nWu Yi Ran died earlier, and now, Wu Yuan Ju and Rong Hao were dead. Because of life tablet Gu and soul lantern Gu, Wu clan received news almost immediately.\n\nWu Yong was enraged, he decided to go out himself.\n\nWu clan lost three Gu Immortals at once, one rank seven and two rank sixes, the losses was tremendous, Wu Yong felt both loss and anger.\n\nHe wants to see who it was that could step past this bottom line and anger Wu clan!\n\nBut next, after seeing Wu Yuan Ju’s and Rong Hao’s corpses, Wu Yong was stunned.\n\n“Wooden statue murder?” His pupils shrunk to pin size: “Qiao Zhi Cai?”\n\nA moment later, Qiao clan Gu Immortal Qiao Zhi Cai rushed to the scene.\n\nBlood tide pit had been suppressed, the ground was completely covered in blood, and there were also two Wu clan Gu Immortal corpses.\n\n“Qiao clan first supreme elder, what do you have to say?” Wu Yong had a calm expression, his tone was very plain.\n\nBut the calmer he was, the more fearful Qiao Zhi Cai was.\n\nHe was Qiao clan’s first supreme elder, his signature immortal killer move was wooden statue murder, if any ordinary Gu Immortal was hit by this, their souls would crumble and disperse, they would lose their life, their bodies would turn into wood, and the remaining life force could be used to grow trees.\n\nIgnoring the cold sweat on his forehead, Qiao Zhi Cai explained: “Lord Wu Yong, please listen, I did not do this, someone is trying to frame me. Qiao clan and Wu clan have a long relationship, we are closely related…”\n\nBefore Qiao Zhi Cai finished his words, Wu Yong interrupted him.\n\nHis eyes were shining, he stared at Qiao Zhi Cai: “Of course I am willing to trust you. Qiao clan and Wu clan, we have marriage connections, we are in an alliance, how can our relationship be ruined by this?”\n\nQiao Zhi Cai let out a breath of air, bowing deeply: “Lord Wu Yong is wise!”\n\nWu Yong continued: “If someone is trying to frame you, this is way too obvious. Who is it? What motives do they have? What plans do they have next? This is what I am concerned about. Wait a while, I have already invited Tie clan Gu Immortal Tie Mian Shen!”"
