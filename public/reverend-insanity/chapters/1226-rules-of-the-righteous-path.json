But Fang Yuan was vigilant to the core, he always considered the many possible outcomes before he did anything.\n\nEver since rebirth, he had been cultivating endlessly, he exerted all of his effort without wasting a moment of his time on useless aspects.\n\nThis sleep was the same.\n\nFang Yuan entered his own dream realm, getting materials from his dream realm, he obtained the Gu materials for many dream path mortal Gu.\n\n“If I refine them, I can get five to six dream path mortal Gu.” Fang Yuan assessed.\n\nHis improvement in dream path was evident.\n\nIn the past, after one dream, he would only obtain a few Gu materials, to refine one or two dream path mortal Gu. But now was different, his gains had risen sharply, his efficiency in getting dream path mortal Gu also rose by many times.\n\nOf course, there was an important element, his soul.\n\nWhen exploring dream realms, the soul would weaken.\n\nThus, the stronger the soul, the longer one could explore the dream realm, and the greater the backlash that they could endure from the dream realm.\n\nWhat was worth mentioning was: No matter how strong the soul was, it was just a basic condition for exploration. A strong soul could not allow one to freely move in the dream realm.\n\nThere was a somewhat unfitting analogy for souls and dreams.\n\nThe dream realm was like a desert, when souls explore it, they are like lost travelers inside the desert. The stronger the soul, the stronger the traveler’s constitution, they could endure hunger and stay inside the desert for a longer time.\n\nBut that did not mean that he could walk out of the desert. He did not know what direction it was, he could not create food and water inside the desert, he could not shrink the desert or leave it freely.\n\nBut clear directions, creation of water and food, and modifying the desert, all of these could only be achieved by dream path at this period of time.\n\nWhy ‘this period of time’?\n\nBecause when all the paths reach a certain attainment level, they can mimic other paths and attain their effects.\n\nIn the future, fire path, earth path, and others can also create their own immortal killer moves that mimic dream path effects.\n\nHowever!\n\nThere was a huge condition.\n\nThat was, dream path had to be developed further as a path, and the Gu Immortal trying to mimic its effect needed to be familiar with dream path and have high dream path attainment.\n\nRight now, dream path had just started being researched, all the forces and Gu Immortals were suffering from exploring it, they did not have many useful gains.\n\nEven though there were quite a few dream path Gu worms and even wild dream path Immortal Gu, dream path as a path itself was still very far from actually being created.\n\nIt was not even properly created yet, not to mention completed.\n\nCreating a whole new path was not so easy.\n\nThere were many water path Gu worms, during the Immemorial Antiquity Era, Remote Antiquity Era, and Olden Antiquity Era, there were countless wild water path Gu worms, there were even people who created new water path Gu worms. But only until the Medieval Antiquity Era did Spirit Affinity House’s founder, Shui Ni, finalize the path after considering all aspects, formally creating water path.\n\nThus, Gu Immortals in the five regions could do nothing about dream path, they knew that it was extremely valuable, but they had no way to gain from it.\n\nMany Gu Immortals died in dream realms.\n\nThis situation was happening everywhere, and some time ago, Southern Border’s Gu Immortals had suffered massive casualties from this.\n\nPrecisely so, Southern Border’s righteous path Gu Immortals noticed the fact and had to slow down their exploration of the dream realm, moving forward with steady steps, carefully progressing slowly.\n\nMany Gu Immortals were still very wary of the dream realm, they started to have different ideas, thus, the immortal opportunity business was born as a result.\n\nIf the righteous path Gu Immortals had ways to explore the dream realm, how could they give up this immense profit to the demonic and lone immortals?\n\nThinking of the immortal opportunity business, Fang Yuan sat up on his bed.\n\nThe immortal opportunity business had to exist, but at the same time, he could not be involved in it excessively.\n\nThe immortal opportunity business had many uses.\n\nOn one hand, it could give Gu Immortals immense benefits. On the other hand, it could greatly reduce the conflict of the righteous path, demonic path, and lone cultivators.\n\nIf the righteous path Gu Immortals defended the super dream realm forcefully, what would these demonic path and lone immortals in Southern Border think?\n\n“The righteous path definitely obtained a lot of benefits, but they are keeping it for themselves. If time passes, the righteous path will get stronger, while we get weaker, how can we live? These are the cultivation resources of Great Dream Immortal Venerable, who does not want to become Great Dream Immortal Venerable? Why is the righteous path allowed to hog it for themselves, without any for us?”\n\nThis would be their mentality.\n\nIt was extremely dangerous.\n\nSouthern Border’s righteous path forces knew that if these people were forced, the demonic and lone immortals would join up and result in another battle of Yi Tian Mountain, or result in the blood battle martial competition of Northern Plains.\n\nWith this immortal opportunity business, the lone and demonic immortals would realize: Oh, the dream realm is so dangerous, there is nothing to gain from it. At this moment, the righteous path can do nothing to it, otherwise, why would there be this business? Are they letting us experience the dream realm on purpose?\n\nCreating this dream realm business was the idea of the rank seven Gu Immortal from Wu clan, he was very astute. Unfortunately, Fang Yuan was stronger and used his brother’s influence to chase this rank seven Gu Immortal away.\n\nFang Yuan needed stability.\n\nThe more stable the better!\n\nHe needed a stable environment to explore the dream realms here.\n\nThus, preventing the attacks of both lone and demonic path immortals here meant that it was necessary to continue the immortal opportunity business.\n\nBut Fang Yuan could not participate.\n\nBecause not all the righteous path clans were participating.\n\nThis was a crucial point!\n\nPut simply, the loot was not distributed evenly.\n\nWu clan and six other righteous path clans were getting the benefits, while the other half of the clans were not participating.\n\nThis was very reasonable.\n\nGu Immortals were moved by benefits, the fewer people who joined, the more they would gain, right?\n\nThus, the result was — once the immortal opportunity business was exposed, all of the Gu Immortals involved would not be able to get away. They would definitely be punished severely, because this was the rule of the righteous path!\n\nFang Yuan could not step into this trap.\n\nWu An and the rest wanted to rope him in, but Fang Yuan knew that once this was exposed, even if he was the owner of two Immortal Gu in here and was the brother of Wu Yong, it was impossible for him to stay here.\n\nFang Yuan was not going to take the risk.\n\nHe went through all kinds of methods to infiltrate here, what was it for? It was for the dream realm!\n\nEspecially when Wu Yong was not someone who favored his ‘brother’ Wu Yi Hai. His attitude would depend on the circumstances.\n\nBut as long as Fang Yuan did not commit a mistake, and was the owner of the Immortal Gu here, Wu Yong would be less likely to send him elsewhere.\n\nFang Yuan could see all these details clearly.\n\nThanks to the five hundred years of his previous life.\n\nEven though his cultivation level was not high, he had been in the righteous path, demonic path, and even was a lone cultivator, he had incredibly rich life experiences.\n\nThis allowed him to be in the righteous path while not being restrained by Wu Yi Hai’s lone cultivator upbringing. He was clear about the political situation here, he knew what to do as a righteous path Gu Immortal, and how to play this game of life.\n\nThus, he recruited Lady White Rabbit.\n\nAt the crucial moment, he could use her as scapegoat, saying that he did not know the matter.\n\nThe immortal opportunity business’ profits that were for him were all given to Lady White Rabbit as well.\n\nHe could not take the profits.\n\nUnlike demonic path or lone cultivators who would crazy after seeing some resources, the righteous path could not do this, some benefits could be gained, but certain benefits were untouchable.\n\nBut what if he rejected her? What if he gave Lady White Rabbit and Wu An the cold shoulder?\n\nThat was worse.\n\nIf Fang Yuan did that, even though there would not be a crisis after getting exposed, he would make enemies with six clans of Gu Immortals. These people were beneficiaries, if Fang Yuan did not lead them, they would not dare to undergo this business. These people would definitely have poor feelings towards him.\n\nFang Yuan would have just arrived at the super Gu formation, and he would have already offended all of the political allies of Wu clan.\n\nAnd all those who did not participate in the immortal opportunity business, like Ba clan, Tie clan, or Shang clan, would be greedily eyeing up Fang Yuan.\n\nIf he did that, he would be crippling his own network, it was an extremely stupid idea.\n\nThe arrangement now was good.\n\nThe immortal opportunity business continued, his political allies were happy, Ba clan and the rest were watching but could not do anything to Fang Yuan, who had no exploitable weaknesses.\n\nIn the future, if this matter was exposed, Fang Yuan would push Lady White Rabbit into the spotlight, sacrificing her and saying that he was doting on her, but to think that she would do something like this behind his back. He was completely kept in the dark and ignorant.\n\nAll in all, Fang Yuan had leeway to retreat or advance.\n\nAs for those profits, Fang Yuan could only give up on them.\n\nHe did not lack resources now, the sovereign immortal aperture’s cultivation resources would put most rank seven Gu Immortals to shame!\n\n“Next, I can officially start exploring dream realms!” Fang Yuan prepared to move.\n\nAt the same time, in Northern Plains.\n\nThe blood battle martial competition was reaching its end.\n\nHeavenly Lord Bai Zu and Yao Huang did not appear from start to finish, but their influence was heavily affecting the competition.\n\nChu Du had an ugly expression.\n\nThe situation was not in his favor.\n\nHao Zhen had lost, he was holding his left shoulder with his right arm. His injuries were severe, his left arm was completely chopped off, the injury area was covered in dao marks, it was hard to heal.\n\n“Northern Plains’ righteous path truly has a deep foundation.” Chu Du sighed, he was in an extremely awkward position of having nobody to send out.\n\nHao Zhen had an angry expression, he spoke with unwillingness to give up: “Lord Chu Du, I have a friend who is stronger than me, but they are a secluded cultivator and have little fame.”\n\nChu Du was joyful and suspicious: “Oh? Why did you not recommend them earlier?”\n\nHao Zhen had a difficult expression, he transmitted carefully: “There is one bad point, they cultivate blood path.”\n\nChu Du’s expression turned solemn, he rejected it without hesitation: “Absolutely not! Any blood path Gu Immortal is a demonic path Gu Immortal. This blood battle martial competition is a competition between righteous path forces, how can this blood path demonic immortal take part?”\n\nOnce they were involved, the other party could slander Chu Du’s side for being demonic path members.\n\nChu Du’s hard work would completely go down the drain.\n\nThis was the rule of the righteous path!"
