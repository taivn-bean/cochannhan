Now that there is a new strong wolf tide, they had no way left to resist it.\n\nAt once, both clans subconsciously stopped battling.\n\n“The reports said there were three thunder crown wolves right?” A clan elder screamed in panic.\n\n“No, this thunder crown wolf has lots of injuries, and the size of the wolf pack isn’t very large either,” Gu Yue Bo forced himself to remain calm and analysed.\n\n“Don’t tell me, this is the thunder crown wolf that attacked the Xiong village?” A clan elder slapped his forehead as he shouted.\n\nThis was very possible, and most likely the truth.\n\nThe clan elders were feeling solemn as one said, “The fact that they appeared here, doesn’t that mean the Xiong clan already…”\n\n“That goddamn Xiong village, how can they be so useless? Not even able to resist a wave of wolf tide!” someone scolded.\n\nBut some were optimistic, “You see, this thunder crown wolf’s forelegs are injured, the muscles have all shrivelled!”\n\nThey followed the voice and observed, regaining some lost morale.\n\nIt was true.\n\nThis thunder crown wolf’s hind legs were developed, but its forelegs were smaller, with shrunken muscles. This caused it to only use the back legs when running, jumping forward like a kangaroo.\n\n“Wait, this doesn’t seem like a thunder crown wolf…” Bai clan leader suddenly thought of something, shivering.\n\n“Lightning lycan!” Fang Yuan had an answer already.\n\n_Five tigers one lamassu, three hounds one molossus, ten wolves one lycan._\n\nThe lycan was also a type of wolf, but it was far smarter than a wolf by many times, and was usually the strategist of a wolf pack. The lightning lycan before them seemed like a thunder crown wolf in appearance, thus a recon Gu Master’s confusion is very common. But it was a true blue myriad beast king, and had intelligence no less than men!\n\nThis lightning lycan, although inferior to an ordinary thunder crown wolf in terms of physical strength, had human intelligence and was far more dangerous than a thunder crown wolf. With a huge army of lightning wolves to command, it was no wonder that the Xiong clan was exterminated by them.\n\n“Go!” Fang Yuan spread his wings and flew into the sky.\n\nThese elders here had undergone long battles, and their battle strength was greatly eroded. They could not deal with the wolf packs, and more crucially, their misgivings towards each other made it hard for the two sides to work together.\n\nFang Yuan turned around and left; the myriad beast king was no joke. Even though there was still two wild Gu worms flying around, he couldn’t care less.\n\nHe had to leave immediately, for any later and he might not have the chance!\n\nKnowing one’s limits and being able to let go and give up, this is the number one criteria to roam the world.\n\n“Retreat, the wolf tide is huge, we cannot do anything to it.”\n\n“Get back to the village and plan our defenses!”\n\nEven though the clan elders have not realized the lightning lycan’s identity, they all had retreating thoughts.\n\nBut at this time, the lightning lycan growled, opening its huge mouth.\n\nIts wolf fangs were sharp as a dagger, and in between, a black lump appeared out of nowhere, forming into a black ball in an instant.\n\nPew!\n\nThe black ball shot out, drawing a curved black trajectory in the air and smashing on the ground.\n\n“It missed?”\n\n“This thunder crown wolf is finished, its aiming sucks!”\n\nThe clan elders shouted about, but Fang Yuan flew even faster.\n\nBam!\n\nThe black ball of mist exploded and under that intense impact, the black mist spread all over the place.\n\nThe speed was faster than the eye could see. In a short moment, it covered over a hundred li (one li = 500m) of radius.”This is the Rank four Wolf Smoke Gu!” Fang Yuan’s heart sank; he had made the most logical response at the first moment. But the black wolf smoke spread too fast, completely enveloping him.\n\nAt once, he felt like he was standing in the middle of the night sky, seeing nothing but darkness. Everywhere was thick smoke, making breathing difficult, and was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nBut thankfully he had the Thunderwings Gu, so as long as he flew up, he could get out of the wolf smoke’s range.\n\nCrack!\n\nIn the next moment, a lightning bolt struck, splitting the thick black smoke apart like a thunder snake or a raging dragon, travelling over a hundred li and assaulting Fang Yuan head on.\n\nThe lightning lycan attacked.\n\nThe lightning was so fast a person could barely react to it.\n\nBut at this crucial moment, Fang Yuan’s battle instinct surpassed the speed of his thoughts, reacting in advance.\n\nThunder Shield Gu!\n\nSky Canopy Gu!\n\nA round lightning shield appeared in front of Fang Yuan, and on his body a white armor appeared as well.\n\nThe raging lightning shone at an eye-piercing brightness like a heavenly dragon roaring, ramming onto the lightning shield.\n\nThe shield lasted less than a second before it broke under the intense force of the lightning.\n\nThe lightning landed on Fang Yuan. At that moment, even though he already shut his eyes, he still felt the light piercing through his pupils.\n\nA intense force assaulted him, causing him to fall.\n\nHe was about to faint as the electric currents moved, paralyzing his muscles, almost causing him to forget to breathe!\n\nPlop, he landed on the ground.\n\nHe finally only managed to regain consciousness after intense pain surged through him like waves.\n\nHe endured the intense pain and numbness, and tried to get up.\n\nThe Thunder Shield Gu was already dead, while the Thunderwings Gu was hit and barely held onto life; it was impossible to use anymore. The Sky Canopy Gu was injured heavily too, looking rather dispirited. After all, it was hit by such a strong electric current.\n\nThe lightning lycan’s attack emitted a Rank four Gu worm’s full power.\n\nThe more a Gu worm advances, the bigger the difference between realms.\n\nFor the attack of a Rank four Gu worm, at least two Rank three Gu would be needed to defend against it. However, the Lightning Shield Gu died because the previous battle had already caused it to sustain much injuries.\n\n“To think that this lightning lycan thought so highly of me…” Fang Yuan laughed bitterly, observing the surroundings.\n\nHis surroundings were dark, full of thick smoke; Fang Yuan was unable to tell directions.\n\n“Be careful, that thunder crown wolf became smaller, it is now as small as a normal lightning wolf and is hiding among the pack,” A clan elder shouted at this time from the smoke.\n\nFang Yuan heard it and his iris shrunk.\n\nThis lightning lycan was too crafty, and very sinister. It probably wanted to eliminate all these Gu Masters, and when it attacked Fang Yuan, it showed that it did not want to let a single one of them off.\n\nThe surroundings quickly shone with countless wolf eyes.\n\nThe sounds of their growls and the sound of the wind from wolf packs running about were all heard by Fang Yuan.\n\nUnder such a dark environment, the Gu Masters’ vision is greatly obstructed. But the wolf packs were unaffected, because they had given up on smell and gained excellent vision.\n\n“I have to get out of here quickly. Who knows if I will encounter that lightning lycan? Even if I do not meet it now, just being surrounded by the wolf packs when I only have 40% primeval essence, it is insufficient to sustain my expenditure!”\n\nFang Yuan quickly considered in his heart, then he activated the Earth Communication Ear Grass.\n\nOver ten roots grew out from his ear and extended outside.\n\nMany voices were heard. There were wolf cries, battle noises, clan elders’ frantic growling and lightning wolves’ sad cries when dying.\n\nToo confusing!\n\nThe Earth Communication Ear Grass’ range was huge, but it could not discern small details.\n\nFang Yuan frowned, only listening to a direction with less noises.\n\nBut quickly he encountered a pack of over one hundred wolves.\n\nLightning wolves ran from the black smoke, each ferocious as ever.\n\nFang Yuan summoned the Chainsaw Golden Centipede and activated the Sky Canopy Gu.\n\nThe razors rotated violently and the centipede was like a large sword, cutting through the black smoke and landing on the wolf’s bodies, causing a rain of blood and bones.\n\nFang Yuan attacked like a boat trying to row uphill, eliminating his obstacles.\n\nNumerous lightning wolves died under the Chainsaw Golden Centipede. But then the second, third… they continued to assault him.\n\n“This lightning lycan is too sinister and diabolic, actually making the lightning wolves surround us from the back.” Fang Yuan had been moving in one direction, and after rushing for a while, he realized the truth at once after he kept encountering lightning wolves.\n\nHe battled as he retreated. After a while, he was bathed in blood.\n\nThe pressure was too large, the surroundings were covered in darkness; he was unable to see anything. Wolf packs rushed in from all directions, and it was difficult for him to deal with it alone.\n\n“Gu Yue Bo, what do you say?” At this time, the Bai clan leader said from within the dark smoke.\n\n“Alright, let’s work together and get out of this first!” Gu Yue Bo shouted, quickly replying.\n\nThis was the forced circumstance of the situation — only through cooperation can they have a chance of survival.\n\nOtherwise, by fighting alone, they would soon expend all their primeval essence on the lightning wolves and be turned into food. That would surely be a bad ending.\n\nHowl!\n\n“Fuck!”\n\nIn the next moment, with a wolf’s cry, an intense explosion was heard and the two clan leaders shouted, no longer able to organise the clan elders.\n\nEvidently, the lightning lycan came out and did a sneak attack.\n\nIt had a man’s intelligence after all. Once it attacked, it was able to interfere with the two clan leader’s plan, and ruined the flow of the clan elders’ resistance.\n\nWithout the two clan leaders to suppress the scene, how can the clan elders work sincerely together?\n\nThis was a huge question.\n\n“I’m unable to go on. My primeval essence expenditure is too high, I need to borrow strength from others!” After killing for a while, Fang Yuan felt exhaustion.\n\nHe had the strength of two boars, but now he felt extremely sore all over.\n\nHis primeval essence was no longer enough. He had injuries all over him, but he was forced to stop using the Sky Canopy Gu.\n\nThe Chainsaw Golden Centipede’s body was dim, its razors already in bad shape. In a short period of time, it had killed up to a thousand wolves, and within that number, there were bold lightning wolves as well.\n\nA few of them were harder than steel, because they had a defensive Gu.\n\nThe Chainsaw Golden Centipede was not invulnerable, and without razors, its attack strength would be greatly reduced, quickly becoming useless.\n\nFang Yuan did not prolong any battles; he quickly moved as he fought.\n\nHe relied on the Earth Communication Ear Grass to analyze the situation. Once he heard a frenzy lightning wolf’s footsteps, he would change directions and try to avoid them.\n\nThe frenzy lightning wolf was a thousand beast king, he could not fight it alone. Once he was pulled into battle, he would fall into encirclement, and that would be a dead end.\n\n“I’m not satisfied!” From the thick smoke, a clan elder cried as his voice came to an end.\n\nFrom the black smoke, the wolf packs attacked, and many clan elders died by the wolf’s mouths, growling in helplessness and indignance.\n\n“I can’t hold on much longer either!” Fang Yuan felt the aura of death, but he was still calm; the more dangerous it is, the calmer his mind.\n\nHis heart did not waver at all. In his previous life, he had been in worse situations.\n\nThe situation right now was still not that bad. With the two clan leaders fighting the lightning lycan, Fang Yuan still had a chance.\n\n“Oh? Fighting sounds ahead.” Fang Yuan heard the noise and changed his direction. He was at his limits, so no matter if it was the Gu Yue clan or the Bai clan Gu Masters, they were useful to him either way.\n\n“Kill! Kill! Kill!” Far away, he heard this Gu Master screaming, battling relentlessly.\n\nFang Yuan sprinted over, and suddenly came to a stop.\n\nBai Ning Bing!\n\nNotes: 狡电狈 – Lightning Lycan, well to be honest it directly translates to ‘Cunning electric 狈’. Since there’s no english word for 狈, Lycan is used. 狈 is actually a legendary wolf in China that may or may not exist; it’s said to have two very short paws in front so it rides on a normal wolf’s back instead. (Or something like that…)\n\n彪 – Legendary/mythical tiger that does not have an equivalent English word. So I just subbed it with lamassu."
