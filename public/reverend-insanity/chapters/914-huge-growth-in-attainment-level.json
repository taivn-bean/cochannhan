Sure! But you…” The beastman leader snickered.\n\nBefore he finished his words, he was interrupted by Fang Yuan.\n\n“I know, if I can’t save them, I will not leave, you can eat me!” Fang Yuan waved his hand, speaking casually.\n\n“Guh…” The beastman leader choked up on his words, he could not say anything else.\n\nThe surrounding children looked at Fang Yuan with hopeful and admiring gazes, as if they were looking at a hero.\n\n“Lad, if you can save them all, I will step down as the leader!” The beastman leader smiled sinisterly.\n\nBut soon, he could not smile anymore.\n\nFang Yuan did not follow the script, he used unravel dream continuously at an incredible pace!\n\nAll of the captured children were saved one after another.\n\nIf he were to untie the wind knot grass through his own efforts, he would not even be able to save himself.\n\nBut after using unravel dream, the difficulty fell immensely.\n\nTo make a comparison, this was like playing mahjong, where everyone else was drawing random tiles, while Fang Yuan was changing the tiles to whatever he wanted.\n\nFrom everyone else’s perspective, this sort of cheating behavior looked like Fang Yuan moving his fingers rapidly, no matter which wind knot grass he held, after turning it a few times over, it would be untied rapidly, until the seed was taken out from its centermost position.\n\nSo simple.\n\nSimply too easy.\n\nThis was the power of the dream path killer move unravel dream!\n\nThe children’s eyes were shining with tears, they looked at Fang Yuan as their gazes was filled with unparalleled gratitude and adoration.\n\nThe beastmen opened their mouths wide, they were dumbfounded, unable to believe this.\n\n“I saved them all, I succeeded.” Fang Yuan spoke calmly at the beastman leader.\n\nA moment later, the children understand the situation and erupted into a deafening cheer, some were sobbing out of joy, some were jumping around excitedly.\n\nThe beastman leader was speechless, he stared at Fang Yuan with bloodshot eyes. The surrounding beastmen were growling or baring their fangs, they were tempted to strike.\n\nFang Yuan was not afraid that the beastmen would go back on their words.\n\nIn most cases, these tribal beliefs were extremely strict, due to the culture and traditions of the tribe, they had to obey it.\n\nOf course, nothing was certain.\n\nIn reality, there was the possibility that the beastman tribe would go back on their words.\n\nBut here, it was special, it was a dream realm.\n\nThis was not reality!\n\nIndeed, like Fang Yuan had expected, the beastmen were furious and discontent, but they could only watch the food that was in front of them leave.\n\nPassing through the dark forest, Fang Yuan led the group of children away from the beastman tribe, they got far away from the bonfire.\n\nThe children gathered around Fang Yuan, they walked together as they fell into silence.\n\nIn the darkness, a speck of light expanded, until light filled his vision.\n\nFang Yuan’s soul returned to his body, he opened his eyes.\n\nTaking a look, Fang Yuan showed a surprised expression.\n\nHe turned to the manifested dream realm behind him, he was filled with questions: “How can this be? I have already saved all the children, I did this to the limits. How can I still be thrown out of the dream realm, and not enter the second scene?”\n\nFang Yuan frowned deeply.\n\n“Don’t tell me, my guess was wrong? Untying the wind knot grass and saving the children is not the correct method to pass the first scene?”\n\n“What clues did I neglect?”\n\nFang Yuan thought intensely, he worked his mind to its limits.\n\nExplorations of dream realms were difficult. Even if Fang Yuan had his previous life’s memories, and was at the forefront of this generation, but when exploring the dream realm, he had no confidence in succeeding.\n\nEvery dream realm was unique.\n\nThe method to explore dream realms varied each time, it was hard to accumulate helpful experiences.\n\nFang Yuan could only guess right now and try every idea he had. He could only persevere and not get frustrated to have a chance of passing the dream realm.\n\nOf course, in Fang Yuan’s previous life, there were many instances where people explored dream realms and failed to make any progress for decades.\n\nFang Yuan felt his head hurting, he had little confidence in his new guesses.\n\n“In that case, I should go elsewhere and subdue the hidden essence turtle.”\n\nFang Yuan had run into a barrier in this dream realm, he would not stubbornly stay in place.\n\nEven though Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s dream realm was his main objective, he still definitely was going to obtain the dragonfish, hidden essence turtle, and the desolate plant.\n\nChanging his train of thought, Fang Yuan left this place, heading to another location.\n\nTwo hours later, Feng Jin Huang’s pale face regained a bit of her rosiness.\n\nShe opened her eyes.\n\nIn her clear eyes, brilliance radiated.\n\n“Guts Gu is truly helpful towards the healing and recovery of souls, it takes effect so quickly.” She was joyful.\n\nSeeing that she was safe, the other four Spirit Affinity House Gu Masters heaved sighs of relief.\n\nThey were here as bodyguards, if anything happened to Feng Jin Huang, they would not have a good time when they returned to the sect.\n\nFeng Jin Huang saw the desolate beast shark fin wolf that Fang Yuan left behind, her gaze focused as she asked the Gu Masters around her, after hearing that during her healing period, no other Gu Masters had gotten close, she relaxed slightly.\n\nFinally, she inspected her body and confirmed that she had healed completely, she stood up and faced the dream realm again.\n\n“Earlier, I used dream wings Immortal Gu and it displayed great capabilities while I was obtaining a boost in my refinement path attainment level. But this time, I am facing an Immortal Venerable’s dream realm, the difficulty is worlds’ apart, I cannot commit my earlier mistake again. Eh? Why does the dream realm look slightly smaller?”\n\nFeng Jin Huang’s gaze concentrated, she showed a suspicious look.\n\nOnce the dream realm was successfully explored, it would vanish.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan did not succeed, he had gained quite a harvest, his wisdom path attainment level rose.\n\nAs the saying goes: Where there are gains, there are losses.\n\nFang Yuan gained something, the dream realm naturally lost something.\n\nIt showed on the surface as the dream realm’s size shrinking.\n\n“It did shrink, how did this happen?” Feng Jin Huang confirmed it repeatedly and felt more suspicious: “Is this Immortal Venerable dream realm special? It will shrink as time passes?”\n\nFeng Jin Huang did not suspect anything else.\n\nIn this era, people’s understanding towards dream realms was still at a primitive and ignorant level.\n\nFurthermore, in Feng Jin Huang’s heart, she believed that her unique dream wings Immortal Gu provided superiority and advantages to her in dream path.\n\nAlthough she was suspicious, she could not verify anything.\n\nEventually, she shook her head, ignoring the sense of suspicion inside her, she entered the dream realm again.\n\nJust as Feng Jin Huang entered the dream realm, Fang Yuan went to the location of the hidden essence turtle in accordance with He Feng Yang’s information.\n\nThis wisdom path desolate beast was huge, it was like a mound.\n\nAt this moment, the hidden essence turtle’s four limbs and head were hidden in its shell, its body was covered and hidden under rocks.\n\nFang Yuan laughed lightly, he swooped down like an eagle ferociously.\n\nBoom boom boom…\n\nIntense explosions occurred, causing thunderous sounds.\n\nFang Yuan and the hidden essence turtle fought.\n\nAt once, rocks flew, smoke was rising up.\n\nThe hidden essence turtle tried to resist at first, but it had no Immortal Gu and was only a desolate beast, not an ancient desolate beast, how could it be the match of Fang Yuan who had rank seven battle strength?\n\nAfter several rounds, the hidden essence turtle could only hide inside its shell and take a beating.\n\n“This turtle shell is really thick…” Fang Yuan attacked against the hidden essence turtle and felt a little surprised momentarily, he laughed in a helpless tone.\n\nHe did not exert his full strength, in fact, he rarely used his Immortal Gu.\n\nHe had used myriad self giant hand in many situations already, it would be best if he did not expose it. Who knew if other sects had preparations involving some investigative Immortal Gu?\n\nFang Yuan needed to conceal his strength as much as possible.\n\nThus, after the hidden essence turtle hid itself, Fang Yuan did not rush.\n\nHe split his focus onto two tasks at once, he made the battle grand and loud while savoring his gains from the dream realm.\n\nAs he thought over it, he had countless inspirations that emerged in him.\n\nIt was like a door had been opened in front of him, he could see the view outside of the house.\n\nThis feeling was incredible amazing, Fang Yuan was drowning in euphoria.\n\n“Earlier, my wisdom path attainment level was extremely ordinary, after all, I only started my wisdom path cultivation recently. But now, my wisdom path attainment level has reached quasi-master level. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s dream realm is simply incredible!”\n\nSuch progress, if it was according to normal cultivation, would take him decades of accumulation.\n\nEven though the dream realm was dangerous, each time he succeeded, he would have great gains, it was truly a great leap forward, Fang Yuan saved a lot of time.\n\n“Why is there such thunderous noise?”\n\nFang Yuan was fighting intensely with the hidden essence turtle, groups of Gu Masters were drawn over to investigate the situation.\n\n“Fang Yuan? How can he be so strong?!”\n\n“No wonder the elders in the sect told us to avoid this monster Fang Yuan!”\n\n“He is simply cheating, this is so unfair to us, how can we compete with this monster?”\n\nEventually, Fang Yuan spend a day and a night to subdue the hidden essence turtle and send it into his immortal aperture. During this period, many Gu Masters were drawn over, but after doing some investigations, they retreated in fear.\n\n“Thirty-sixth failure…”\n\nFeng Jin Huang opened her eyes in fatigue.\n\nEver since she was heavily injured, she had become careful, unfortunately, she did not have unravel dream, and had never interacted with wind knot grass previously. She failed a total of thirty-six times, not even untying it correctly once.\n\nBeing able to survive in the dream was the most basic requirement for successfully exploring a dream realm.\n\nFailing to untie the wind knot grass meant she could not survive, the explorations failed.\n\nThus, each time Feng Jin Huang explored the dream realm, the injuries to her soul after failing far surpassed that of Fang Yuan.\n\nShe had to spend a lot of time to rest and recover.\n\nThus, after two days and one night, she only explored it thirty-six times.\n\n“The Immortal Venerable’s dream realm is so tough, I have dream wings Immortal Gu but it is still so difficult for me, not to mention others!” Feng Jin Huang looked at the dream realm in front of her with a bitter expression.\n\nShe was filled with dejection and frustration, right now, as long as she thought about the appearance of the wind knot grass, this proud young genius would feel like vomiting!\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan secretly got close to the dream realm.\n\nHe had already captured the hidden essence turtle and nether grass, he was going to put his remaining time into the Immortal Venerable’s dream realm.\n\nAfter going through some intense deductions, Fang Yuan had a new idea.\n\nJust as Feng Jin Huang was anguished and dejected, Fang Yuan smiled confidently as he secretly entered the dream realm again."
