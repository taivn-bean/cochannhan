These Gu Immortals were doing the same thing as Ren Zu now.\n\n“Damn it, I cannot continue anymore!” At the next moment, Yu Yi Ye Zi reached his limits, he could not continue anymore, he was washed away by the tides.\n\nAnd the second Central Continent Gu Immortal, followed by the third.\n\nShi Zheng Yi gave it his all, but he failed and was washed away by Reverse Flow River.\n\nBu Zhen Zi was unwilling, but he could only float away.\n\nBi Chen Tian and the rest were showing ugly expressions as each Central Continent Gu Immortal got eliminated.\n\nNot long after, out of the Central Continent Gu Immortals, only rank eight Wei Ling Yang was left.\n\nBeing able to reach rank eight, he truly had shocking willpower!\n\nWei Ling Yang showed the foundation of a rank eight great expert.\n\nAs for those Gu Immortals who were washed away, they were all gathered by Bi Chen Tian and went back to the group, they were not obstructed by Old Ancestor Xue Hu, or the dog tail life extending ferret Mao Li Qiu.\n\n“Why is it that our Gu Immortals were all swept away, but these random people are still inside the river?” Some Central Continent Gu Immortals were very unhappy towards Ying Wu Xie’s gang and Fang Yuan.\n\n“At merely rank six, their willpower is truly shocking. But we were all defeated, they will fail soon.” A Central Continent Gu Immortal who was just swept out of the river said.\n\nBut they did not managed to see Fang Yuan or Ying Wu Xie fail, before a situation occurred around Ma Hong Yun.\n\nMa Hong Yun, who was swimming forward, choked on the river water as he was nearly swept away.\n\n“Be careful!” Bi Chen Tian couldn’t help but call out.\n\nYing Wu Xie was overjoyed, but soon, Ma Hong Yun continued to swim forward, moving his arms.\n\nIt was just a scare.\n\n“It’s that girl, hehe, her willpower is shocking too.” Mao Li Qiu could see the subtle details.\n\nAt the crucial moment, Zhao Lian Yun had helped Ma Hong Yun and stabilized his condition.\n\nThe truth was, after Reverse Flow River went back to normal, the river surface became smooth, it did not challenge one’s physical stamina as much. Especially towards the upstream, the river became more shallow, but its reflective power against willpower and mental energy became stronger.\n\n“Hong Yun, we cannot be separated anymore.”\n\n“Do you know, in order to be with you again, how much have I experienced, how much hardship have I gone through, and how much I have lost?”\n\nZhao Lian Yun had lost her voice and could not speak, but at this moment, she had no such energy anyway.\n\nHer aged body was unleashing strength that even Zhao Lian Yun could not believe she had.\n\nZhao Lian Yun had forgotten about her stamina and age, she was purely wanting to be together with Ma Hong Yun.\n\nEven if they were swimming for their lives, and could not even look at each other.\n\nEven if she could not speak, and danger was right behind them.\n\n“No matter how bad the situation is, I need to persevere. Every minute and second that I spend with him, fighting alongside him, regardless of the situation, I have never been so blissful!”\n\nMa Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun continued moving forward, even though they were slow, the situation was stabilizing.\n\nIt was just a scare.\n\nBi Chen Tian and the other Central Continent Gu Immortals, and even Flood Extremity and Black Extremity, were having their hearts shake from the shock.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu snorted coldly, he did not conceal his disappointment.\n\nThe immortals watched Reverse Flow River, every action caused deep emotions to form in their hearts.\n\nEven though some of them were rank eight existences, and even though the rank six and seven Gu Immortals were experts among those with the same cultivation level, elites of their regions.\n\n“Even my immortal zombie body is feeling tired?” Ying Wu Xie smiled bitterly.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was on his head, pulling Ying Wu Xie’s hair, he was causing a din as he cried or laughed at times.\n\n“I am just a split soul of the main body, I have not lived for a long time.”\n\n“But since coming to life, I knew that I had my own responsibilities!”\n\n“Right now, Lord Purple is crazy, I cannot ignore him, he might choke to death in the river, I am Shadow Sect’s only hope.”\n\n“Even if I die from exhaustion here, I cannot give up. Only by capturing Zhao Lian Yun and Ma Hong Yun can I stall for time until Lord Purple awakens again!”\n\nHis duty was making Ying Wu Xie persevere.\n\nBai Ning Bing gritted her teeth, her chest was pumping up and down.\n\n“Hehehe,” she even laughed lightly, her face was distorted, excitement was in her eyes.\n\n“Exciting!”\n\n“This is truly exciting!”\n\n“In Reverse Flow River, I have experienced a new type of excitement never felt before, this is the road that Ren Zu once walked on!”\n\n“Interesting, this is simply too interesting!!”\n\n“Even if I fail, this trip was worth it. Even if I die, this life was worth it!”\n\nHei Lou Lan was filled with anger.\n\n“How can I stop here?”\n\n“Mother, I have not avenged you yet!”\n\n“I have not killed that man with my own hands yet!”\n\n“Argh!”\n\n“I need to persevere…”\n\nHei Lou Lan was trembling, she was showing indomitable willpower.\n\nHowever, as time passed, some people could not persevere.\n\n“Will my excitement end here?”\n\n“I… have not… taken revenge yet…”\n\nBai Ning Bing and Hei Lou Lan were out of energy, they were washed away.\n\nBut their safety was ensured, Old Ancestor Xue Hu was already waiting for them outside.\n\nThis way, there were only six people left in Reverse Flow River.\n\nMa Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun were still at first place.\n\nYing Wu Xie and the crazy Purple Mountain True Monarch were second.\n\nFang Yuan was third.\n\nWei Ling Yang was fourth.\n\n“There is still hope!” Right now, Old Ancestor Xue Hu’s hopes were all on Ying Wu Xie.\n\nAs long as Ying Wu Xie captured Ma and Zhao, Old Ancestor Xue Hu’s side would gain the initiative, they would be able to threaten Bi Chen Tian and the others, as well as Longevity Heaven’s dog tail life extending ferret.\n\nBut if Ma Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun were swept away, then everyone would have a chance, a huge battle would occur, it was unclear who would win. It would depend on their strength and also luck.\n\n“Lord Wei Ling Yang, it will depend on you now.” Bi Chen Tian thought, he clenched his fists that were full of sweat.\n\nThe dog tail life extending ferret was laughing.\n\nIts eyes were staring at the river, thinking of something.\n\n“Ah! The glory of Heavenly Court…” A moment later, Wei Ling Yang sighed out loud as he reached his limits, despite his unwillingness, he was washed away by Reverse Flow River.\n\nCentral Continent’s Gu Immortals were shocked, they were completely stunned.\n\nSomeone screamed in disbelief: “How can this be? Lord Wei Ling Yang is a rank eight Gu Immortal, how could he lose to these people?”\n\n“Swimming in Reverse Flow River has nothing to do with cultivation level, it depends on your willpower.” Someone explained.\n\nCentral Continent’s Gu Immortals were silent, did this mean that the great rank eight Central Continent Gu Immortal, Wei Ling Yang’s willpower, was inferior to these people?\n\nBi Chen Tian slowly spoke: “Don’t forget, Ma Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun had rested on the floating mound earlier, according to the information, they even had fruits to eat, when Reverse Flow River engulfed everything, they were at the front, the Gu Immortals behind them also went through many struggles, their stamina and willpower were greatly expended.”\n\nThe Central Continent Gu Immortals finally realized.\n\n“That’s true.”\n\n“Even though Lord Wei Ling Yang lost, if they had the same starting point, he would definitely be the victor!”\n\nBecause of Bi Chen Tian’s words, the Central Continent Gu Immortals’ morale stabilized.\n\nBi Chen Tian was expressionless, his mood was heavy.\n\n“What do we do now?” Bi Chen Tian was hesitant.\n\nThe Central Continent group had a huge disadvantage.\n\nThe wise choice was to retreat and preserve their strength. They could go to black heaven and try to meet with Myriad Tidal Dragon, using the Immortal Gu House to see if they could turn this around.\n\nThere was a third option, it was to stay here and contest for Ma and Zhao with Old Ancestor Xue Hu and the dog tail life extending ferret.\n\n“We should discuss this after Wei Ling Yang returns.” This was a huge matter, Bi Chen Tian could not make the decision, he was not the leader, Wei Ling Yang was.\n\nBut while they were waiting, another change occurred in Reverse Flow River.\n\n“I… will not give in!” Ying Wu Xie bellowed as he raised his head, but Reverse Flow River engulfed him as he was swept away.\n\n“Is it finally ending! Ying Wu Xie, die!!” Fang Yuan screamed internally, he was waiting for this moment all along.\n\nHe collided heavily with Ying Wu Xie.\n\nBoth sides were fighting in the water, they stopped advancing.\n\nThis way, Fang Yuan and Ying Wu Xie, as well as Purple Mountain True Monarch, could not help but be washed downstream by Reverse Flow River.\n\nSovereign immortal body versus the strength path immortal zombie.\n\nUndeniably, Ying Wu Xie was at a disadvantage, he was quickly beaten until he suffered bone fractures by Fang Yuan’s punches and kicks.\n\nBut the immortal zombie body was dead to begin with, its only weakness was the brain. Even the heart was not a weakness.\n\nFang Yuan had become an immortal zombie for some time, he naturally knew this, but Ying Wu Xie was defending his head, he disregarded the rest of his body and only protected his skull.\n\nUndeniably, this was a wise decision.\n\nOnce he stalled for time and Fang Yuan was swept out of Reverse Flow River, Ying Wu Xie would counterattack.\n\nDon’t forget, Hei Lou Lan, Bai Ning Bing, and Old Ancestor Xue Hu were already outside the river.\n\nAmong everyone here, Fang Yuan was the only one who was truly alone.\n\nHe was racing against time!\n\nFang Yuan wanted to kill Ying Wu Xie and Purple Mountain True Monarch before they got out of Reverse Flow River.\n\nWhile Ying Wu Xie was stalling for time, trying to survive.\n\nFang Yuan was not able to do anything to Ying Wu Xie at the moment."
