The floor was slowly covered in hard ice, preventing the Chainsaw Golden Centipede from emerging and attacking.\n\nThis iceblade storm is a unique move of Bai Ning Bing’s. Evidently it showed the battle talent of the Northern Dark Ice Soul physique.\n\nThis was formed by the Iceblade Gu, Swirl Gu and Fierce Wind Gu. When used together, it created something that could attack and defend. Without two or more defense Gu working together, one cannot resist it.\n\nThe fierce winds roared and the ice blades froze all in its path. The white storm assaulted like a huge beast awakening, opening its mouth and devouring Fang Yuan.\n\nThese three Gu together form a ferocious offensive technique that can freeze all life. Even with the Sky Canopy Gu’s defense, Fang Yuan would probably be unable to block it.\n\nThe storm approached, but Fang Yuan showed a look of disdain.\n\nThe thunderwings behind him instantly flapped, pulling a large distance away from this iceblade storm.\n\nTimes were different now. If this was the past, his movement speed would be lower than this storm, but now the storm could no longer catch up to him.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shone with brilliance as he turned his direction in mid-air, and flew towards the valley.\n\nThe iceblade storm chased him relentlessly.\n\n“Don’t come here!”\n\n“Fuck off!!”\n\nWhether it was the Bai clan Gu Masters, or Gu Yue clan, both were scolding and shouting.\n\nFang Yuan laughed coldly, continuing his charge.\n\nThe iceblade storm had an imposing aura as it continued to chase Fang Yuan while Bai Ning Bing’s laughter was heard from within.\n\n“Don’t think of getting any further!” A Bai clan Gu Master blocked Fang Yuan’s path.\n\nFang Yuan’s hand hooked, and from the ground a thick and long golden line jumped out and landed on his right arm, like a large sword.\n\nBuzz buzz buzz!!\n\nThe rampaging sound from the razors caused the Bai clan Gu Master’s eyelids to shiver.\n\nFang Yuan held the Chainsaw Golden Centipede in his right hand as blood light shone in his left – he was using the Blood Moon Gu but not shooting it. His body was covered in a white coloured armor, and thunderwings sparked behind his back. His black hair flew in the wind, and behind him there was a mountain-sized white storm.\n\nHis presence was overwhelming with his eyes emitting sharp killing intent, as if he was charging through the desert, a general with seven victories under his belt. Stomping all his enemies into minced meat, and chopping any opponents into broken bones.\n\n“AHHH!” The Bai clan Gu Master felt an impossible pressure as veins popped on his forehead, and he suddenly shouted loudly, edging himself on.\n\nBut as he shouted, seeing Fang Yuan was rushing towards himself without pause, he suddenly shut up and ran away.\n\nHe was scared!\n\nThe fear in his heart eroded his fighting spirit.\n\nFang Yuan did not care about him, instead rushing over towards the thunder crown wolf who was on the verge of dying.\n\nWinds blew as his charging was fearsome, and everywhere he went, Gu Masters avoided.\n\nThe thunder crown wolf forced itself to focus, turning its head towards Fang Yuan. Lightning gathered on its teeth; the myriad beast king’s pride refused to let itself die so easily. Even through death will it retaliate!\n\nFang Yuan was seemingly about to collide onto the thunder crown wolf like a meteor hitting earth, but at the last second he suddenly jerked his leg and rushed up into the sky, flying out of the valley at a steep angle.\n\nHe had just flown out of the valley when an intense explosion occurred behind him.\n\nThe thunder crown wolf’s cries fused with the sound of the ice blade storm.\n\nA move like the iceblade storm could be said to be Bai Ning Bing’s masterpiece, but it had weaknesses too – it could not be easily displayed or stopped.\n\nOf course, this storm knocking into the thunder crown wolf was also due to Bai Ning Bing’s personality.\n\nThe thunder crown wolf was heavily suppressed by the white storm.\n\nIt was already going to die, but now it could resist no further. Its armor was cut into pieces and blood and flesh flew all over the place, revealing its white skeleton, which was quickly minced into bone matter.\n\n“Damn it!” Seeing this, the Gu Yue clan’s side all swore.\n\nThe Bai clan Gu Masters also showed a pained expression.\n\nWith Bai Ning Bing doing this, after the thunder crown wolf dies there would no longer be any valuable loot left on its body.\n\nBut Bai Ning Bing did not mind it. Instead he rotated even faster, enjoying the feeling of devastating a myriad beast king.\n\nGu worms turned into rays of light one after another, flying out of the thunder crown wolf’s body.\n\nThese wild Gu worms had all resided in the thunder crown wolf’s body, using each other to work together and survive. Now that the thunder crown wolf was dying, they were like crewmen on a ship, abandoning the sinking ship and escaping for their lives.\n\n“Catch them!”\n\n“Quick, stop these Gu!”\n\nThe two clans shouted at once.\n\nThe situation went into chaos again as clan elders attacked each other in attempt to hinder the other. The two clan leaders could not split themselves, thus finally, only two or three clan elders with movement-type Gu managed to fly out of the valley.\n\nThe wild Gu worms ran everywhere and Fang Yuan focused and observed, trying to discern them.\n\n“What a pity my recon Gu is Earth Communication Ear Grass, it cannot increase my vision. There is definitely a healing-type Gu on this thunder crown wolf, but whether I can catch it or not, it’s up to fate!”\n\nThis was betting purely on luck, but Fang Yuan had no choice.\n\nRecon-type Gu worm, there were all sorts of them, but right now he only had the Earth Communication Ear Grass.\n\nHis thunderwings spread and he rushed towards the closest Gu worm.\n\nThis Gu’s body was covered in a blue light, trying to fly far away.\n\nFang Yuan rushed up, opening his hand and grabbing it.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nIts body emitted an intense electric current and assaulted Fang Yuan.\n\nThunderwings are formed by lightning, it has speed but is not flexible. Fang Yuan groaned as he used the Sky Canopy Gu to endure this attack.\n\nHe could forcefully grab this Gu, but he wisely chose to give up.\n\nThe ability of this Gu was already exposed; it was able to use electric currents to attack enemies, so this was obviously an attack-type Gu, but Fang Yuan wanted a healing Gu instead.\n\nFang Yuan gave up on it and approached another Gu worm.\n\nWhen he got close, he saw this Gu’s appearance, a body that seemed to be made of light blue glass, flying in the air with a semicircle shell that had turtle shell markings.\n\nThunder Shield Gu!\n\nThis was a defensive Gu, able to form a semicircle lightning shield.\n\nFang Yuan gave up once again, looking around and finding his third target.\n\nBut at this time, a white shadow came from the valley, holding an iceblade and shouting Fang Yuan’s name.\n\nFang Yuan sighed, knowing that lady luck was not on his side. He could only take the best alternative, reaching and grabbing towards the Thunder Shield Gu right next to him.\n\nThunder Shield Gu created a lightning shield, its eerie blue lightning sparking as it tried to resist Fang Yuan’s hand.\n\nFang Yuan sneered, releasing the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura. Suddenly the Thunder Shield Gu became tame like it died, dispersing its shield and falling towards the forest.\n\nFang Yuan waved and grabbed it in his hand, releasing his primeval essence and instantly refining it.\n\nStealth Scales Gu!\n\nRipples formed all over his body as he vanished on the spot.\n\n“Fang Yuan!” Bai Ning Bing shouted, as his eyes shone with lightning.\n\nThis is the Rank three Lightning Eye Gu, using the power of lightning to break through stealth.\n\nBut it did not have see-through vision. Fang Yuan noticed this, and although he was stealthed, he could also use the forest to conceal himself. Bai Ning Bing’s gaze swept through the environment and angrily growled as he had no findings.\n\nFang Yuan found a hidden spot, instantly sitting down and activating the tusita flower, making it spit out primeval stones.\n\nAlthough he was Rank three, his aperture only had 42% primeval essence storage, and though he had the upper hand during the previous battle, it could not be sustained. Right now, his aperture only had a thin layer of primeval essence left, being around 3%.\n\nGu Masters needed primeval essence to activate Gu worms.\n\nWithout primeval essence, Gu Masters’ battle strength would drop drastically. In fact in extreme situations, they were even worse than mortals.\n\nThe primeval stones continued to shrink, the natural essence injecting into Fang Yuan’s body. The primeval sea in his aperture started to rise gradually.\n\nBack then, when he was Rank one or two and using the primeval stone to replenish his primeval essence, it was very noticeable. But now that he was Rank three, as the Gu Master’s primeval essence quality is greatly improved, more primeval stones are required and a longer time is needed to replenish it.\n\nSounds of Gu Masters battling continued to be heard. After eight or nine minutes, Fang Yuan replenished the primeval essence in his aperture back to the limit.\n\nHe came out of his hiding spot, discovering that five clan elders had died.\n\nAmong them, three were from Gu Yue clan, two from Bai clan.\n\nEach clan elder was the clan’s asset. To think that so many were sacrificed this time.\n\nGu Yue Bo and the Bai clan leader’s battle was very intense. They were feeling heartache from their respective losses, thus getting more aggressive in their attacks.\n\nOther than this, there were three fighting groups surrounding the wild Gu worms.\n\nOrdinary Gu Masters do not have the Spring Autumn Cicada’s help to capture wild Gu worms, thus it was troublesome.\n\nTo catch the Gu worm, they cannot deal heavy blows. Instead, they need to gauge the strength they use.\n\nEight to nine Gu worms had flown out of the thunder crown wolf. It was not certain how many Gu worms they had captured, but three still remained right now.\n\nThe clan elders surrounded these three Gu worms, striking as they blocked the worms while facing obstruction from the other party. This caused the scene to be at a stalemate, neither sides able to gain anything.\n\n“Water Cage Gu, trap it!” A Bai clan Gu Master shouted, spitting out a water ball.\n\nThe ball increased in size until it was over two metres, covering the Gu worm completely and trapping it inside.\n\nBam!\n\nIn the next moment, a golden moonblade flew towards the water ball cage and burst it open by force.\n\nThe Gu worm flew away, escaping with its life.\n\nSeeing this Gu worm fly away, the Bai clan Gu Master cursed. To think that a Gu worm at his mercy got away just like that!\n\nThe Gu Yue clan Gu Masters were even more furious. These Gu worms were originally their battle rewards, but now that the Bai clan interfered, they could not gain anything.\n\n“Bai clan scoundrels, shameless dogs, go to hell!”\n\n“Gu Yue clan, you guys are finished. Our Bai clan will definitely rise up and stomp you all to the grounds!”\n\nBoth sides were furious, full of hatred and madness. They had battled till their eyes turned red, and only fighting remained in their minds.\n\nFang Yuan saw the Gu worm fly away, thus he had no choice but to look at the other two groups. There was still a Gu worm at each of their encirclement. There might be a healing Gu worm, but it was unlikely.\n\nFang Yuan knew that this world did not have things like ‘a wish coming true’, but even so he wanted to try.\n\nJust when he was about to rush up and attack, he heard a wolf’s howl like a military horn, spreading out in rhythm, rising and falling in succession.\n\nSoon after, tons of lightning wolves rushed down like tide water.\n\nThere was no lack to the sound of bold lightning wolves and frenzy lightning wolves, but the one that made everyone’s expression change was the mountain-like giant wolf.\n\nThunder crown wolf!\n\n“There’s a fourth thunder crown wolf?!” The clan elders shouted as they could not keep their calm anymore."
