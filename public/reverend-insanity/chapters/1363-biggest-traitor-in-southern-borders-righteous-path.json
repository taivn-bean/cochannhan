This was a crucial turning point in their relationship.\n\nPrecisely because of this, at this moment, when Fang Yuan initiated the cooperation, Ying Wu Xie nodded, replying: “Then let’s work together.”\n\nYing Wu Xie was not against working together.\n\nOr rather, he was once against and hated the idea when Purple Mountain True Monarch mentioned it, he did not understand why.\n\nBut people change.\n\nIf this was during the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain, Ying Wu Xie was new to life, he knew nothing, he would not consider working with his enemy.\n\nWhen Shadow Sect was strong, Fang Yuan was weak as an ant, Ying Wu Xie would never work with Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter losing in Yi Tian Mountain, Ying Wu Xie hated Fang Yuan, there was no way for them to cooperate. Ying Wu Xie only wanted to regain Shadow Sect’s former glory.\n\nBut as Fang Yuan grew stronger and went after Ying Wu Xie multiple times, Ying Wu Xie started to feel deep wariness in his heart. Recently, when Fang Yuan chased them to Northern Plains, other than wariness, Ying Wu Xie also felt fear towards Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter the battle of Reverse Flow River, Ying Wu Xie developed a new emotion towards Fang Yuan.\n\nThat was — admiration.\n\nFang Yuan did what Ying Wu Xie was unable to do, he was truly worthy of being chosen by heaven’s will to return to the past and disrupt Shadow Sect’s plans.\n\n“It is not that I am not strong, but that my enemy is Fang Yuan!” Ying Wu Xie had such a thought and realized that his losses were not that unacceptable.\n\n“How are we going to cooperate? I can’t hang on anymore.” Ying Wu Xie said directly.\n\nFang Yuan frowned, Ying Wu Xie had a very direct attitude, Fang Yuan was slightly surprised.\n\n“Of course I will help you people first, Heavenly Court is too strong, there is only hope if we work together.” Fang Yuan sighed, transmitting to the Xia clan Gu Immortal who was fighting Ying Wu Xie.\n\n“Retreat? Why must I retreat? I already know about my enemy’s weaknesses, I can win this.” The Xia clan Gu Immortal was very confused.\n\n“A Yao clan Gu Immortal is in great danger, you need to help him. Quickly go, I am overseeing the entire battlefield, how can you understand the big picture like me?” Fang Yuan said without politeness.\n\nThe Xia clan Gu Immortal was very unhappy, but because of Wu Yi Hai’s status, and the fact that he was in control of the super Gu formation, he snorted in his mind before leaving.\n\n“How are you going to help me? Quickly do something!” Ying Wu Xie urged, but suddenly, his eyes widened as he looked at his opponent in shock, he retreated while having a discontent gaze at Ying Wu Xie, rapidly flying away.\n\n“Stop making a fuss, I already helped you.” Fang Yuan said at an appropriate timing.\n\nYing Wu Xie heart shook, asking: “Didn’t you say that was not you?! Is he one of your subordinates?”\n\n“Enough pointless chatter, tell me, what is Shadow Sect’s plan? Don’t tell me you have no backup plans.” Fang Yuan immediately asked.\n\nYing Wu Xie smiled bitterly, replying: “Of course we do, our backup is me.”\n\nRumble!\n\nAn intense explosion occurred, from the raging air currents, Purple Mountain True Monarch flew out of the endless profound lights as he charged down.\n\n“Why are you escaping? Fight me!” Behind him, Duke Long chased.\n\nHis long hair was fluttering, his muscular body had changed, not only were his dragon horns sharper and longer now, his hands had turned into dragon claws, his dragon tail was waving behind him, his skin was covered with a layer of dragon scales.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch looked pathetic, but his gaze was clear like water.\n\n“Duke Long, history states that he cultivated qi path primarily, but because of his lacking lifespan, he also cultivated transformation path.” Purple Mountain True Monarch analyzed in his mind.\n\n“Just his transformation path methods are already so powerful, as expected of someone on par with Bo Qing.”\n\n“Let him try this move.”\n\nThinking of this, Purple Mountain True Monarch’s body shook, he turned around agilely, flying upwards.\n\nAt the same time, his ten fingers fluttered like he was playing a zither.\n\nSwish swish swish…\n\nAnd endless stream of purple starlight specks shot out of his fingers, piercing through space and attacking Duke Long.\n\nThese starlight specks were extremely dazzling, not only were they fast, they flew in the air with a trail of light behind them, it was extremely beautiful.\n\nDuke Long grunted, he felt that these purple starlight specks were not simple.\n\nHe quickly used his attacking methods against them.\n\nBut these purple starlight specks were very agile, they quickly dodged Duke Long’s attacks as they aimed directly at him.\n\nDuke Long saw this and praised in his mind: “As expected of a wisdom path cultivator, his immortal killer moves are agile and nimble, especially this move, it is extremely refined. I cannot compare to him in this aspect.”\n\nWisdom path Gu Immortals had endless thoughts, they were most skilled in controlling immortal killer moves, and creating attacks of varying styles.\n\n“Why must I get bogged down? It is wiser to make use of my advantages.” Duke Long ignored these purple starlight specks, using his powerful defense to take on the starlight specks and charging ahead fearlessly.\n\nSeeing this, mysterious light shined in Purple Mountain True Monarch’s eyes.\n\n“He finally fell into my trap.”\n\nIt turned out that his move had a hidden effect. Upon contact with any immortal killer move, it would transmit some fragmented information to Purple Mountain True Monarch.\n\nCountless fragmented pieces of information would combine and expose the secrets of the immortal killer move.\n\nWith enough information, Purple Mountain True Monarch would be able to target Duke Long’s defensive method and retaliate against it.\n\nDuke Long’s offensive approach after confirming the power of the purple starlight specks suited Purple Mountain True Monarch’s tactic.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch had always been feeling troubled by Duke Long’s defense. After getting enough information, Purple Mountain True Monarch used a new immortal killer move.\n\nHe pushed with both palms as large amounts of cloud mist appeared, blocking Duke Long from advancing.\n\nDuke Long’s dragon eyes flickered with sharp light, after looking at it, he instantly saw the power of this immortal killer move.\n\nHe laughed heartily as he charged into the purple mist.\n\nInstantly, he lost his sense of direction entirely.\n\nDuke Long immediately stopped, staying motionless as he opened his mouth, emitting a loud dragon roar.\n\nThe dragon roar reverberated in the entire area, the purple mist became thinner until it faded away.\n\nDuke Long saw Purple Mountain True Monarch again, he was still retreating, attempting to pull away from Duke Long.\n\nDuke Long laughed, his figure vanished and appeared before Purple Mountain True Monarch instantly!\n\n“Eat my fist.” Duke Long shouted loudly, striking with his right fist directly.\n\nThis was not an immortal killer move.\n\nIn such a short time, Duke Long had to maintain his concentration on his various defensive killer moves, he did not activate any other immortal killer moves.\n\nBut with his physical toughness, his normal fist had incredible offensive power.\n\nBam.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch could not dodge in time, he was directly hit by Duke Long’s fist.\n\nBut his chest that was punched flickered with profound light, his body was basically unharmed.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch had incredible defensive methods too.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was uninjured from Duke Long’s punch, he even used the force of the fist to accelerate his retreat backwards.\n\nBut at the next moment, Duke Long appeared beside Purple Mountain True Monarch again, punching.\n\nBam.\n\nThe same scene appeared again, but Duke Long chased relentlessly, no matter where Purple Mountain True Monarch flew to, he could instantly teleport over and punch with his fists.\n\nDuke Long’s punches rained down endlessly, countless fist shadows enshrouded Purple Mountain True Monarch.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was like a rubber ball, thrown around by Duke Long constantly, he was taking a beating without being able to retaliate.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was flickering with profound light, defending against Duke Long’s fists.\n\nSoon, Duke Long’s punches were no longer so simple.\n\nChaotic dragon fist!\n\nAn immortal killer move was activated.\n\nBut the effect was low.\n\nDuke Long thought: “My chaotic dragon fist will cause the thoughts in my enemy’s mind to become chaotic if it hits. With a flurry of punches, my opponents will not be able to think, they will only take hits passively. But this effect does not appear on him at all.”\n\nAt Duke Long’s level, he can already achieve the traits of other paths. Duke Long’s transformation path killer move had wisdom path effects.\n\nBut when it was used on a wisdom path Gu Immortal, Purple Mountain True Monarch, it was simply child’s play.\n\nDuke Long could punch his other enemies with death with chaotic dragon fist, but against Purple Mountain True Monarch, he only had the upper hand.\n\nWhile Duke Long was probing Purple Mountain True Monarch’s wisdom path attainment, Purple Mountain True Monarch was also analyzing Duke Long.\n\nEven though he was taking hits, he was calm in his mind, with no hint of panic.\n\nWisdom path had three aspects, thoughts, wills, and emotions. Purple Mountain True Monarch had methods to eliminate his negative emotions in battle.\n\n“Duke Long’s movement is evidently an immortal killer move, allowing him to teleport continuously.”\n\n“Inside his dragon eyes, there is another immortal killer move with powerful investigative effects.”\n\n“With my initial deduction, his teleportation does not depend on where he looks. Don’t tell me…”"
