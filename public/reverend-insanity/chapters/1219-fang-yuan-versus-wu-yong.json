This was an undeniable point, it was Fang Yuan’s advantage.\n\nWu Yong was different, he resembled his father, he had complementing eyes and brows, he looked very ordinary, he had a natural unremarkable aura.\n\nBut Wu Yi Hai was different.\n\nHe was handsome and muscular, he stood out from the crowd like a spear stabbing at the sky. Even though he lived in Eastern Sea, his traits were very similar to Wu clan Gu Immortals, especially his nose, it was wide and tall, at a glance, people could tell that this person was very extraordinary, he had a firm personality and could not be looked down upon.\n\nOf course, the reason why Fang Yuan could give off such an impression was highly attributed to his appearance.\n\nThe real Wu Yi Hai did not have the traits of a Wu clansman.\n\nRank eight immortal killer move — Familiar Face!\n\nThieving Heaven Demon Venerable’s signature method, it was displaying its worth right now, all of these Gu Immortals were deceived, none of them could tell that Fang Yuan was an impostor.\n\nThe truth was, even Wu clan’s Gu Immortals were seeing Wu Yi Hai for the first time.\n\nUndoubtedly, Fang Yuan’s prior preparation and hard work was rewarded now. When Wu clan’s Gu Immortals looked at him, they held some good feelings towards him.\n\nBecause Wu Yi Hai looked like Wu Du Xiu.\n\nWu Du Xiu was not beautiful, she had features that suited a man, if she were a male, she would be a grand hero that could rival heaven.\n\nWu Yi Hai bore seventy percent resemblance to her.\n\nWu Du Xiu died, Wu clan was in a commotion, the clan’s Gu Immortals were all in remembrance of Wu Du Xiu’s achievements and glory.\n\nAfter all, humans were like this, they did not feel much attachment towards people when they were still alive, but the moment they were gone, they would want to cherish and appreciate them.\n\nFang Yuan appeared at this juncture, it made good use of the immortals’ mental state.\n\nOf course, this was part of Fang Yuan’s calculations.\n\n“Alike, they really look alike.” Even other clans’ Gu Immortals were sighing.\n\nFang Yuan sensed sharply that the gazes on him were changing slowly.\n\nIn the five hundred years of his previous life, he did not have the achievement of high cultivation level, but he had gone through five hundred years of life, he had nurtured an unfathomably deep ability to observe situations, and an acute perception towards the changes of emotions in the Gu Immortals near him.\n\nHe sensed that the gazes of Wu clan’s Gu Immortals were welcoming, while Wu Yong’s gaze carried animosity in it.\n\nWu Yong was indeed shocked.\n\nFang Yuan had disguised as ‘Wu Yi Hai’ and appeared, this greatly affected his plans and arrangements.\n\nWhat made Wu Yong alarmed was that Fang Yuan and Qiao clan’s Gu Immortals were together, he felt a sense of wariness.\n\nThe truth was, Wu Yong hated this younger brother of his in the deepest part of his heart.\n\nEven though both sides were meeting for the first time.\n\nWu Yong did not like Fang Yuan at first sight.\n\nBecause Wu Yi Hai looked too much like his mother Wu Du Xiu.\n\nSo many years.\n\nWu Yong had followed by Wu Du Xiu’s side, growing under her protection.\n\nWu Du Xiu was a giant tree, the leaves of the tree protected the entirety of Wu clan, including Wu Yong himself.\n\nWu Yong felt like he was constantly lowering his head, the shade of the tree was a type of shadow that loomed over his life.\n\nHe was Wu Du Xiu’s son, but do not forget, he was a man.\n\nMen naturally sought strength, having an intense desire towards authority.\n\nBut all along, Wu Yong was under Wu Du Xiu’s shadow, her strength, her abilities, as well as her identity, Wu Yong could not resist her, he had to lower his head.\n\nWu Du Xiu passed away, Wu Yong was naturally very upset and grieved, but at the same time, unavoidably, he felt freedom, he felt… joy.\n\nThis joy was something that Wu Yong did not dare to admit he felt.\n\nBut now, when Wu Yong saw this Wu Yi Hai who resembled Wu Du Xiu, he unavoidably felt some feelings of dislike.\n\nFang Yuan sensed Wu Yong’s ill intent and animosity, even though he disguised himself well.\n\nFang Yuan knew on the inside: “The first step of showing myself succeeded, but the second step of interacting with Wu clan and getting them to acknowledge me is the crucial one.”\n\n“Being accepted by Wu clan means getting Wu Yong, this rank eight Gu Immortal, the first supreme elder of Wu clan’s acknowledgement!”\n\nThus, when Fang Yuan stepped into the limelight, he bowed deeply towards Wu Yong: “Wu Yi Hai pays respects to elder brother.”\n\nWu Yong had an agitated but hesitant expression: “Are you really my brother Yi Hai? Alike, you really look like mother, except that your eyes are blue, we don’t usually have that eye color in Southern Border.”\n\nThat sentence had deep meaning.\n\nWu Yong did not directly acknowledge Fang Yuan’s identity, instead, he pointed out the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal identity of ‘Wu Yi Hai’ seemingly unintentionally.\n\nFang Yuan answered solemnly: “Reporting to brother, I had black eyes before, but some accidents occurred when I cultivated transformation path. Right now, I returned due to mother’s arrangement. Unfortunately, I met with many attacks along the way, Uncle Zhang and Brother Leng, who traveled with me, died on the battlefield while protecting me as I escaped.”\n\n“Both Zhang and Leng were simply attendants of my mother, but they made great contributions to Wu clan. Pass my orders, we will give them a grand burial, according to the rules of how we treat external supreme elders. Their descendants will also be taken care of, and be treated as equals in our Wu clan.” Wu Yong instructed.\n\nThe supreme elders quickly responded.\n\nFang Yuan heard this and snickered internally.\n\nThis Wu Yong refused to give up any chance to show off his wise image, but hearing his words, he did not accept Fang Yuan’s identity. He avoided the important topic, taking about Zhang and Leng and ignoring the important point — his brother Wu Yi Hai.\n\nWu Yong ignored this part, but Fang Yuan was not helpless.\n\nThis could not stop him.\n\nFang Yuan bowed as he said: “I hope brother can allow me to pay respects to our mother!”\n\nWu Yong’s brows tightened.\n\nFang Yuan’s words were very logical, as a son, his mother had passed away, how could he not pay respects to her?\n\nThis was an extremely reasonable request, especially in a clan system where bloodline was crucial in maintaining relationships, even Wu Yong could not stop him.\n\nIf he said no, outsiders would react badly to it, his new image that had been painstakingly created would be completely ruined.\n\nBut if he did not refuse Fang Yuan’s request, then that would mean that Wu clan was acknowledging Fang Yuan’s identity, that he was a member of Wu clan!\n\nAs a matter of fact, Wu Yong did not want that.\n\nWu Yong disliked Wu Yi Hai’s appearance.\n\nWu Yi Hai’s identity was a headache to Wu Yong.\n\nWu Yi Hai came here with Qiao clan, it was a huge warning to Wu Yong!\n\n“This Wu Yi Hai should go back to where he came from. Isn’t he an Eastern Sea Gu Immortal? Then let him develop in Eastern Sea, even if I have to spend some resources to get him to leave.”\n\nThis was the best result for Wu Yong.\n\nIn fact, Fang Yuan’s performance and the Qiao clan Gu Immortals’ testament made Wu Yong not suspicious towards Fang Yuan’s true identity.\n\n“Wait, what if I get rid of this Wu Yi Hai?”\n\n“I could not do it earlier because mother was around. But now, I am first supreme elder, this is my territory, in time, I will gain control of the clan, I can make arrangements in secret and execute him, wouldn’t that end my troubles?”\n\n“Even if he is in Eastern Sea, it is a problem. If he is not in Eastern Sea and stays in Southern Border, the problem is even bigger.”\n\n“I might as well agree to his current request. Eventually, I can go through some arrangements and demonstrate him to be a fake, I will be able to openly get rid of him!”\n\nThinking of this, Wu Yong felt intense killing intent surging in him.\n\nHe was about to speak, and directly agree to Fang Yuan’s request, when suddenly, a supreme elder of Wu clan said: “Pardon me, but is everyone forgetting to confirm second young master Wu Yi Hai’s identity. I am not suspecting him, or suspecting anyone from Qiao clan, but for him to come back to the clan, that is a necessary procedure!”\n\nWu Yong heard this and his brows tightened again.\n\nHe looked at the Wu clan Gu Immortal who spoke deeply, it was Wu clan’s third supreme elder, Wu Qiao 1 .\n\nThe gazes of Fang Yuan and Qiao clan’s first supreme elder met secretly, he thought: “It was right to contact Qiao clan, but I did not think that Qiao clan had infiltrated Wu clan so deeply, reaching up to the third supreme elder, Wu Qiao.”\n\nQiao clan’s first supreme elder looked at Fang Yuan, thinking about the scene in which they schemed and collaborated…\n\n“As long as I appear during the funeral, Wu Yong would be in a passive position. Even as a rank eight Gu Immortal who can easily kill me with his strength, he cannot do anything to me there. Hehehe.”\n\nFang Yuan laughed as he continued: “He will not attack or kill me. Because he is Wu clan’s first supreme elder, he is not a lone cultivator or a demonic cultivator. By then, if I request to pay respects to our mother, what can Wu Yong do to stop me?”\n\n“Hahaha, brilliant, truly brilliant!” Qiao clan’s first supreme elder gave a thumbs up: “Privately acknowledging your heritage is too dangerous. If we do this, it is brilliant, even if Wu Yong disagrees, what can he do?”\n\nFang Yuan said seriously: “Thus, we must undergo the acknowledgement during the funeral. If we miss this chance, it will be difficult. Not only would the risks be higher, Wu Yong would not even give us any opportunity.”\n\n“Don’t worry, by then, I will speak up and suggest this.” Qiao clan’s first supreme elder smiled.\n\n“No, no, no.” Fang Yuan shook his head: “It is unsuitable for you to suggest it, you are an outsider, how can you interfere in Wu clan’s business?”\n\nQiao clan’s first supreme elder fell into silence.\n\nFang Yuan’s words directly addressed his biggest concern. This was a huge problem he was facing. If this was not solved, he could not cooperate with ‘Wu Yi Hai’.\n\nFang Yuan’s arms were behind his back, he raised his head and looked outside the window: “Therefore, I need a supreme elder from Wu clan, he can openly suggest this, and steer the situation towards the heritage acknowledgement.”\n\nQiao clan’s first supreme elder was a bit troubled: “This…”"
