Fang Yuan felt this was one of the most beautiful sights in the world.\n\nWhen the rank nine Immortal Gu House, Heaven Overseeing Tower, sent out the attack which it had prepared for a long time, Fang Yuan was like a bystander that had been implicated, unable to avoid it.\n\nHis only remaining option was to activate Spring Autumn Cicada.\n\nHowever, the rank six Spring Autumn Cicada had a huge flaw. There was a chance of failure every time it was used!\n\nAt Qing Mao Mountain, Fang Yuan successfully activated it once.\n\nAt San Cha mountain, Fang Yuan successfully activated it again.\n\nIf his previous life of five hundred years was counted, then Fang Yuan had already successfully activated Spring Autumn Cicada three times.\n\nNow, he had finally failed.\n\nSpring Autumn Cicada's activation failed.\n\nAlthough his will entered the river of time, at the moment of activation, Spring Autumn Cicada self-detonated, turning into countless fragments.\n\nFang Yuan's will was like a baby that had lost the small boat it was in and was drowning.\n\nThe surging river of time would engulf and destroy Fang Yuan's will in an instant, not even a trace would remain.\n\n\"In the end, I still failed…\"\n\nAt the moment of death, Fang Yuan's remaining will was strangely tranquil.\n\nThere was no worry, no discontent, and no regret.\n\nWhen he had first chosen this path, he had already expected the situations that could occur, the situation right now had already been within Fang Yuan's consideration.\n\nHe could do nothing now.\n\nHe had already done everything he could.\n\n\"If a chance was given to me again, I would still choose to live this way. Hehehe, so be it, my story as a Gu Immortal shall end here. Although I did not leave behind any biography or inheritance, but… it doesn't matter.\"\n\nFang Yuan's will was quickly dissipating.\n\nHe was tranquil, even feeling happy in a way.\n\nIf he still had a face, the corners of his lips would probably be curled up into a smile right now.\n\nDying while pursuing one's goal, what regrets could he have?\n\n\"Hehehe… hmm?\"\n\nFang Yuan's laughter abruptly stopped, a strange change was occurring at this moment.\n\nFrom the remote and grand river of time, a ghost face suddenly came out.\n\nThe ghost face first looked at Fang Yuan's remaining will and made faces, seemingly in silent mockery.\n\nThen, the pitch-black ghost face's cheeks swelled up, its expression seemed like one of extreme suffering, like it was going to vomit.\n\nA giant flower bud, dripping wet, came out from the ghost face's mouth.\n\nThe ghost face's mouth almost ripped apart, its lips had stretched to an exaggerated degree, even reaching its ears.\n\nAfter vomiting out the flower bud, the ghost face relaxed before starting to make faces at Fang Yuan again, it was amusingly comical, but at the same time was a ghastly and terrifying smiling expression.\n\nAnd that flower bud started to slowly blossom in the river.\n\nTime seemed to have stopped at that moment.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the flower bud opened, turning into an enchanting red lotus!\n\nFrom the center of the lotus shot out a slightly red light ray that landed at the area where Spring Autumn Cicada had shattered, the time in the red light began to turn back.\n\nAt the same time, the ghost face that had carried the red lotus slowly sank down into the river.\n\nLike a movie being played backwards, everything began to go backwards.\n\nAs if water spilled from a basin was returning.\n\nFang Yuan's will had almost completely dissipated, the scant few bits remaining were negligible. But under the illumination of the red light, his will began to rapidly restore and countless Gu worm fragments also began to appear.\n\nAnd when these Gu worm fragments joined together, they turned into an intact Spring Autumn Cicada!\n\nSpring Autumn Cicada carried Fang Yuan's restored will, and began to set on its path again.\n\nThe red light dissipated, the red lotus immediately scattered, and that ghost face also had been completely washed down into the endlessly surging river of time.\n\nIt was as if everything had been an illusion.\n\nHowever, Spring Autumn Cicada was already forcibly restored.\n\nIt carried Fang Yuan's will, carrying Fang Yuan's remaining hopes as it flowed in the river.\n\nFlowing backwards….\n\nReturning to the past!\n\n…\n\nStar Form blessed land.\n\nPoisonous fog was spreading, poisonous blood was boiling, three layers of Gu formations were already destroyed by corrosion, the surrounding land turned into a thin layer of poisonous swampland.\n\nFang Yuan's face was stern.\n\n\"Next is the most troublesome and difficult to process immortal material, earthly limit astral qi.\"\n\nHe took out an immortal material and held it in his hands.\n\nThis Gu refinement material was very peculiar, it was made up of soil and qi. They gathered into a lump.\n\nAt the top was light azure colored astral qi, below was black soil.\n\nAstral qi was the heaven qi found up in the nine heavens. Outside the immemorial nine heavens was a thick wall of astral qi. If a Gu Immortal wanted to explore the nine heavens, they would need to break through the astral qi wall.\n\nMeanwhile, the black soil was made up of the essence of earth qi condensed from the ten depths.\n\nHeaven and earth qi could not coexist, but at this moment, this earthly limit astral qi was joined together in harmony. Not only were they existing peacefully, they were converting into one another constantly. Black soil turned into astral qi while astral qi turned into black soil.\n\nFang Yuan shook it by moving his hands rapidly, as this lump of earthly limit astral qi melted, fusing with the black soil and becoming a lump of fog.\n\nBut after shaking, after a dozen breaths, the black soil sank while the astral qi stayed on top. Black and white was separated again, the two were rotating, it was a mystical sight.\n\n\"Processing such an immortal material is most troublesome. Ordinary refinement path killer moves cannot deal with it perfectly. Only the four publicly recognized strongest immortal killer moves to deal with immortal materials — slumbering lightning python, reflect snow, muffled thunder stone drum, and wind grind, can complete this step instantly. Unfortunately, I do not have any of these four immortal killer moves, to process the earthly limit astral qi, I can only put in much time and effort.\"\n\nFang Yuan's thoughts flashed as he moved his feet, his huge body shot into the air, he leaped and jumped into the turtle shell, into the poisonous blood.\n\nBoom!\n\nFang Yuan flashed his sharp nails, causing injuries on his six monstrous arms, he next slashed at his chest, back, and other areas, creating openings on his skin.\n\nBlood refinement killer move — Blood Trace Travel.\n\nFrom these injuries, traces of blood appeared.\n\nThe blood traces quickly fused into the dark purple poisonous blood, the poisonous blood in the turtle shell was drawn away, it moved into Fang Yuan's wounds.\n\nIntense pain assaulted him, Fang Yuan snorted.\n\nImmortal zombies did not have a sense of pain, Fang Yuan could feel pain because he used Gu worm methods. He needed to feel pain so that he could know what step the immortal materials were at.\n\nFang Yuan's blood and the poisonous blood in the turtle shell acting as a pot continued to fuse and circulate, they were entering and exiting Fang Yuan's body.\n\nAfter this process stabilized, Fang Yuan took out the earthly limit astral qi and swallowed it.\n\nGulp, the earthly limit astral qi entered his stomach.\n\nThis was his own original method, created in his previous life, an abnormal technique using blood path to refine Gu. He called this the flesh body blood refinement technique.\n\nThe earthly limit astral qi entered his body, it was engulfed by the blood and slowly melted into the blood.\n\nBlood flowed out of Fang Yuan's body through the wounds, into the turtle shell pot, and sank to the bottom.\n\nAt the same time, the other poisonous blood in the pot flowed into Fang Yuan's body through the wounds, engulfing the earthly limit astral qi again.\n\nTime slowly passed, three days and two nights later.\n\nFang Yuan was covered in wounds, the pain made his face distorted, his eight monstrous arms were inserted into the poisonous blood, his fangs were exposed and his eyes were red, he was breathing heavily like an ox.\n\n\"Still… still a night remaining, I need to completely process all the earthly limit astral qi in my body… as long as I can get past this step, the most difficult part of refining change form Immortal Gu would be over… uh!\"\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan's pained expression stiffened.\n\nUnder his deep frowning expression, his bright eyes suddenly showed confusion, almost losing all their luster.\n\nWhen refining Immortal Gu, one had to maintain high degrees of concentration, how could he be allowed to be distracted?\n\nPff—!\n\nHe immediately spat out a large mouthful of poisonous blood.\n\nShortly afterwards, he fell down heavily in the poisonous blood in the giant turtle shell, raising a huge wave of blood.\n\nThe bloody wave splashed out of the turtle shell, into the grassland; soon, a large patch of healthy green grass turned into dark red smoke due to the corrosion.\n\n\"Master!\" Star Form land spirit shouted worriedly, jumping into the turtle shell.\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan's head emerged from the pool of blood.\n\nHe splashed around twice, before standing up.\n\nThe confusion on his face quickly disappeared, his gaze brimming with energy as he mumbled: \"This is… this place?\"\n\nHearing Fang Yuan's mumbling, Star Form land spirit became even more worried: \"Did master lose his mind because of the refinement failure?\"\n\nFang Yuan gazed at his hands first, then swept through the turtle shell and the blood pool, before finally stopping on Star Form land spirit.\n\n\"What time is it now?\" Fang Yuan asked.\n\nStar Form land spirit jolted inwardly, but still replied: \"Many days have already passed since master began refining the Immortal Gu.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha…\" Fang Yuan raised his head and laughed heartily.\n\nStar Form land spirit felt bleak: \"Oh no, master has lost his mind! After failing the Immortal Gu refinement, his body suffered heavy injuries, he has even forgotten the time, and is still laughing so happily!\"\n\nThere was no need for Fang Yuan to tell others about the reason for his happiness.\n\n\"I have returned once again!\"\n\n\"Despite the activation of Spring Autumn Cicada failing, because of a strange change, I returned to life from death, from defeat to victory, my will has once again returned to the past.\"\n\n\"I am still refining change form Immortal Gu… the time is over a year ago? This is actually so short!\"\n\n\"According to my foundation and with so many Immortal Gu on me, I should have at least traveled several hundred years back. Is it because Spring Autumn Cicada failed to activate that I only returned to a point over a year ago?\"\n\n\"Also, that ghost face and the red lotus, what was going on… what had happened?\""
