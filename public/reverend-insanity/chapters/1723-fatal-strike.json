What method did Duke Long use to make his immortal killer moves grow so powerful? It is a pity that Seven Extreme Desolation is much weaker now as fate Gu recovers due to the decreased power of call of the ancient killer move, otherwise, if they had their original power, Duke Long would be heavily injured from the attack earlier!”\n\nSeven Extreme Desolation was an ancient battle formation made of three rank eights and four rank seven Gu Immortals.\n\nEach of them were elites of the Huang Jin tribes in their time, they were famous in Northern Plains. And most importantly, the killer moves that they used were the trump cards of the respective tribes. For example, Chanyu tribe’s winged blade and Ye Lui tribe’s immortal binding rope.\n\nWith Seven Extreme Desolation restricting Duke Long’s attacks, the situation went into a deadlock again.\n\nCalamity Luck Altar was temporarily safe, but Longevity Heaven’s side could not destroy the refinement path formation no matter what they did.\n\nHeavenly Court had three layers of Gu Immortals both inside and outside, they formed a tight defense, the Northern Plains experts could not even get close to the formation, not to mention getting inside. In fact, Gu Immortals were already starting to set up new defensive formations outside the refinement path immortal formation.\n\n“This looks like a deadlock but the initiative has been lost, at this rate, Heavenly Court will simply continue the battle of attrition.” Bing Sai Chuan had a cold expression but determination still shined in his eyes.\n\nNorthern Plains’ Gu Immortals loved to fight, they had countless battles in their life, far more than other regions’ people.\n\nBing Sai Chuan was a time path rank eight great expert, he was the same. He had experienced countless difficulties in life, even though the situation was increasingly dangerous now, his fighting spirit did not waver.\n\nHe was trying to find a way out.\n\n“The plan to invade Heavenly Court had been closely planned by my Longevity Heaven, we have our methods to retaliate.”\n\n“For now, we need to communicate with Fang Yuan and the rest, to target the outside world instead.”\n\nBing Sai Chuan immediately contacted Fang Yuan and the rest, giving his orders.\n\n“Luck path method again, they are communicating with the outside world.” The moment Bing Sai Chuan acted, a few of Heavenly Court’s members sensed it.\n\nFairy Zi Wei smiled bitterly, the supreme profundity of luck path was held by Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, Heavenly Court could not stop Bing Sai Chuan.\n\nEmperor City.\n\nFang Yuan had activated emperor yama killer move as he flew rapidly in the sky.\n\nWinds blew around him, in his vision, Li Huang and Qing Ye were like two torches that charged towards him in the darkness.\n\nFang Yuan stretched out his finger, countless yama children flew out to obstruct Li Huang and Qing Ye.\n\nNext, he attacked the closest Immortal Gu House.\n\nThe Gu Immortals inside that Immortal Gu House were shocked, they quickly retreated.\n\n“Fang Zheng, quickly use that move!” A Gu Immortal shouted.\n\nGu Yue Fang Zheng was also inside this Gu House, he immediately acted as the Immortal Gu House shot out a blood light that moved it with several times the speed, causing Fang Yuan to miss his target.\n\nUsing this chance, Li Huang and Qing Ye arrived and fought against Fang Yuan again.\n\nThe Western Desert Gu Immortals could not take it as they mocked: “This is clearly a blood path method, the great righteous path Heavenly Court is actually using blood path killer moves in public right now!”\n\n“Bullshit, my Central Continent has unfathomable methods, how can you fools understand what we are doing?”\n\n“Western Desert scoundrel, you are jealous of my Central Continent’s wealth, this is slander towards the righteous leader of humanity, this is unacceptable!”\n\nHow could Central Continent’s Gu Immortals acknowledge it, even though most of them knew that this was Fang Zheng’s blood path methods after all.\n\n“Damn it.” Fang Yuan gritted his teeth, Li Huang and Qing Ye were too annoying, he felt like he was stuck in a swamp.\n\nIn this current situation, his best method was great thief ghost hand, using this move, he could destroy many of the Immortal Gu Houses of Heavenly Court.\n\nBut Li Huang and Qing Ye were disturbing him, he did not have a chance to succeed.\n\nBut Western Desert was also very wary of him, they did not want to cooperate.\n\nFang clan had a secret cooperation with Fang Yuan but how could they expose that in public right now!\n\nFang clan had obtained Divine Bean Palace years ago and that caused Western Desert’s righteous path to gang up on them, they were keeping a low profile now. Using this Refinement Path Convention as a chance, they made an agreement with Western Desert’s righteous path forces. If they worked with Fang Yuan now, they would be giving the righteous path forces more excuses to suppress them afterwards.\n\n“This is not looking good, the competition is nearing its end!” Fang Yuan had participated in the Refinement Path Convention before, he was clear of the situation now.\n\n“Most importantly, why are those fools from Longevity Heaven not doing anything? Hmm?” At this moment, Bing Sai Chuan contacted Fang Yuan.\n\nTowards Fang Yuan, he would naturally not use an authoritative tone, but Bing Sai Chuan knew how to convince Fang Yuan, he told him everything regarding Longevity Heaven’s invasion of Heavenly Court!\n\nThese were all truths, they had no loopholes.\n\nBing Sai Chuan did not hide or make up anything because he knew about Fang Yuan’s wisdom path attainment.\n\n“These bunch of snakes!” Fang Yuan learned about what happened in Heavenly Court as brilliance flashed in his eyes, he gritted his teeth in anger.\n\nHe made use of Longevity Heaven and treated Bing Sai Chuan and the rest as pawns, was it not the same in reverse?\n\nLongevity Heaven had their own goals, right now, they were being truthful because they wanted Fang Yuan to cause chaos and prevent Heavenly Court from repairing fate Gu fully.\n\nInside Heavenly Court, Longevity Heaven was only able to stabilize the situation and stall Heavenly Court’s experts, they had no chance of winning.\n\nBut if Fang Yuan destroyed Emperor City and ruined the competition, Heavenly Court’s human path methods would be stopped, they would not be able to take success dao marks from Infallible blessed land.\n\nWithout success dao marks, how could Yuan Qiong Du dare to repair fate Gu?\n\nThis was the only chance of victory!\n\nBreathing in deeply, a cold light flashed across Fang Yuan’s eyes.\n\nEven though he knew that Longevity Heaven was making use of him, this open scheme was in line with his own benefits, he had to do it!\n\nActivating his immortal killer move, Fang Yuan moved like a phantom as he dashed around with shocking speed.\n\nEverywhere he went, Heavenly Court’s Immortal Gu Houses avoided him, because of Fang Yuan, the defensive line of Heavenly Court was in complete chaos.\n\nIt was a pity that at this time, Western Desert’s Immortal Gu Houses were all restricted by Heavenly Court, they also had no motivation to go all in, they were unable to make a breakthrough.\n\nLi Huang and Qing Ye arrived again and interrupted Fang Yuan.\n\nUsually at this time, while Fang Yuan was busy with Li Huang and Qing Ye, Heavenly Court’s defensive line would be reformed.\n\nBut it was different now!\n\nFang Yuan roared, turning into the immemorial year monkey.\n\nImmortal killer move — Spring Scissors!\n\nImmortal killer move — Summer Fan!\n\nBe it spring scissors or summer fan, Fang Yuan aimed at the Emperor City below.\n\nThis made Li Huang and Qing Ye’s expressions change.\n\n“Be careful, demon Fang Yuan is going all in!”\n\n“Stop him!”\n\nLi Huang and Qing Ye’s killer moves landed on Fang Yuan, winter coat killer move resisted them with difficulty, rank eight immortal essence was expended rapidly.\n\nAll the Immortal Gu Houses flustered, they tried to defend Emperor City by blocking the attacks.\n\nUsing this chance, Western Desert’s Immortal Gu Houses attacked.\n\nFang Yuan ignored everything, he focused his killer moves on Emperor City.\n\nWinter coat killer move was finally unable to hold on, it broke with a loud sound, Fang Yuan’s flesh was torn and his bones broke from countless attacks. Fang Yuan forcefully activated winter coat killer move disregarding the damage to the core Immortal Gu or his injuries.\n\nBut the core Immortal Gu of winter coat killer move was already damaged, now that it was used, the defensive power was much weaker, it continued to get broken by attacks. Eventually, Immortal Gu Winter succumbed to its injuries and got completely destroyed.\n\nFang Yuan was no longer able to use winter coat, he lost his main defensive method, thankfully, the immemorial year monkey had a strong body to begin with, Fang Yuan also used many time path methods that were better than nothing.\n\nFang Yuan’s relentless attacks had some great effect.\n\nEmperor City was shaking, the Gu Masters who were in the competition got disrupted as their refinement failed.\n\n“What happened?”\n\n“The entire city is shaking!”\n\nThe Gu Masters were shocked and uncertain.\n\nThe Central Continent Gu Immortals who were inside Emperor City quickly made their move.\n\n“Protect these Gu Masters!”\n\n“Don’t let them die.”\n\n“These people are blessed by Central Continent’s human path luck, they are people with great fortune. If many of them die, our luck will not be able to resist demon Fang Yuan.”\n\nIt turned out that Heavenly Court’s arrangements also considered the element of luck.\n\nEven though Heavenly Court did not have too much confidence in luck path, they could use this rough method to eliminate Fang Yuan’s advantage in luck path.\n\n“Ah, a chance! Fang clan’s immortals, the best opportunity is before us.” Inside Immortal Gu House Chicken Dog Coop, Fang clan’s rank seven Gu Immortal shouted as his eyes shined.\n\n“Kill!”\n\nChicken Dog Coop was manipulated by Fang clan’s Gu Immortals, they crashed towards Emperor City while moving extremely close to the ground.\n\nHeavenly Court’s attention was completely drawn to Fang Yuan.\n\nIf Chicken Dog Coop used an immortal killer move, it would be detected, they would lose the chance as Heavenly Court would return to defend the city.\n\nBut now, Chicken Dog Coop gave up on all methods, they charged directly without reservation, they had used their time optimally!\n\n“Oh no!” Li Huang, Qing Ye, and the rest were pale with shock.\n\nUndoubtedly, Chicken Dog Coop chose the best timing to attack, at this moment, Heavenly Court could only watch as it crashed into Emperor City.\n\nEven though they had several immortal killer moves, there was too little time, they did not have enough power to stop Chicken Dog Coop.\n\nClose, they were close.\n\nThe Gu Masters in Emperor City were still unaware while Li Huang and the other Gu Immortals had looks of despair.\n\nThe fatal attack was going to land!"
