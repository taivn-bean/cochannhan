Many sea creatures would often die to them due to a battle of attrition.\n\nEven rank three Gu Masters were not their match in a drawn out fight.\n\nThe deep sea had too much danger. On the surface, the sea was calm, but under the sea, undercurrents surged, dangers lurked everywhere.\n\n“No need to worry.” Fang Yuan transmitted before waving his hand at the crucial moment.\n\nAt the next moment, the Gu Masters of the fishing village were so shocked their eyes almost popped out!\n\nA huge whirlpool formed instantly, it crashed into the sea spiders, it was like a tornado that swept away all of the sea spiders in it.\n\n“Quickly leave, I cannot sustain it for long.” Fang Yuan said purposely.\n\nThe fishing village’s Gu Masters realized at once and quickly dived deeper.\n\nAfter they got to a safe distance, the Gu Masters turned back to look, the whirlpool had started to dissipate. The sea spiders were completely disoriented, they had low intelligence and moved according to instinct, seeing that the prey vanished, they gathered again and moved away.\n\nThe Gu Masters relaxed at long last, their gazes towards Fang Yuan was filled with admiration and reverence.\n\nThe Gu Masters who fought against Fang Yuan earlier finally saw how powerful this Master Chu was! And most importantly, his method was very wise.\n\nIf they fought in the sea, the blood would attract more problems.\n\nTrapping but not killing, that was the work of an expert.\n\nThe group continued to move with Fang Yuan as their guardian, they met with no danger.\n\nSea spiders were just one of the lurking dangers, oil collecting Gu Masters faced hundreds of types of aquatic beasts, sometimes, they would even get swept into special currents, helplessly moving along with them.\n\nIn the following journey, some problems still occurred, but they were not disasters like the sea spiders.\n\nDiving and stopping continuously, after some hard work, they finally reached the Earth Trench.\n\nThey did not need to dive into the Earth Trench, because there was a lot of black oil here already. There had been no Gu Immortals who came to excavate them.\n\nThe Earth Trench was filled with black oil, at the same time, some gushes of black oil leaked outside. These black oil streams were like octopuses with long tentacles, they also seemed like seaweed, messy and scattered.\n\nThe fishing village’s Gu Masters quickly used their Gu worms to get close to the leaking black oil.\n\nThey started to collect the oil, moving around like worker bees.\n\nFang Yuan did not act, he watched from afar.\n\nThese Gu worms specially used to collect black oil were the core and vital Gu of these Gu Masters, Fang Yuan did not ask them about this in their previous interactions because it was taboo, but with his ability, he could understand everything with just a single look.\n\nHis refinement path quasi-supreme grandmaster attainment level was not a joke!\n\n“The number one resource around this unnamed island is black oil. When I use this black oil as material to refine Gu worms for them, their efficiency will increase.”\n\nWhile he was thinking of this, suddenly, a huge group of seashell sharks approached them.\n\nThese sharks opened their bloodthirsty mouths, full of shells that were used as sharp teeth.\n\nThe seashell sharks were very special.\n\nThey began life without teeth, instead, when they grew up, they would choose seashells in the sea and put them in their mouths. As time passed, these seashells would take root and grow, the more years that pass, the whiter and tougher they would become.\n\nThe seashell sharks would use the shells as teeth to tear prey that were stronger than seashell sharks apart.\n\nThis special relationship made infant seashell sharks very weak, but when they reach adulthood, they would be overlords of the sharks.\n\nThis group of sharks were attacking, be it individual or group strength, they far surpassed the sea spiders. But the fishing village Gu Masters were not afraid.\n\nThey moved around the black oil terrain with ease and agility. From time to time, they would spray the black oil that they collected as barriers to shield themselves.\n\nSeashell sharks were huge and could not move easily in this black oil area, if the oil stuck to them, they would become slower and even struggle to move as the oil got thicker.\n\nThe fishing village Gu Masters used the territory to quickly feed these seashell sharks to the black oil as food.\n\nThese seashell sharks struggled until they had no strength left, they were slowly devoured by the black oil.\n\nNormally speaking, the black oil would take a long time to completely corrode these seashell sharks, all of their flesh, bone and blood would turn into new black oil.\n\nBlack oil was an immortal material that contained food path dao marks, it was not safe, the Earth Trench filled with black oil was a dangerous area.\n\nFang Yuan saw this as he sighed in his heart.\n\nHe remembered that in the five hundred years of his previous life, he had once seen how the black oil devoured its prey for the first time. From that day on, he had nightmares for several nights, of the black oil sticking onto him and slowly devouring him without any hope of salvation.\n\nNormally speaking, oil collecting Gu Masters would work in groups, they were afraid that the black oil would stick to them and kill them in the process of collection.\n\nBut the oil collecting Gu Masters in the fishing village would not form groups, it was too easy for disputes to arise, and encountering dangerous situations might cause everyone to perish.\n\nRight now, everyone grouped together, but it was a special situation.\n\n“I advise that you try to drag out the seashell sharks that are trapped, these are all usable Gu materials.” Fang Yuan transmitted.\n\n“Master Chu, these seashell sharks are polluted by the black oil.” The old village head hesitated.\n\n“Don’t worry, I have a way to remove the black oil. Trust me, these seashell sharks are very useful for you.” Fang Yuan smiled.\n\nHe had designed a Gu recipe that used these seashell sharks as the main material.\n\nWithout water shell Gu, these Gu Masters would not believe him, but after Fang Yuan displayed such strength, the old village head stopped hesitating, he ordered: “You all heard him, hurry up and do it. But be careful, don’t let the black oil stick to you, it is too troublesome otherwise.”\n\nNot just troublesome, the price would be huge!\n\nBlack oil was an immortal material, once it got stuck, the food path dao marks would be carved onto the Gu Master’s body. Just the problem of conflicting dao marks would be fatal, and because they had mortal bodies, they could not endure the corrosion of the black oil.\n\n_1_“Don’t worry, I can remove the black oil on you even if it sticks to you.” Fang Yuan spoke.\n\nHis words made the Gu Masters overjoyed, but even with his assurance, the Gu Masters still acted carefully, they were afraid of touching this beloved and accursed black oil.\n\nThe seashell sharks were all dragged out.\n\nMost were not dead, they still had some vitality.\n\nFalling into the black oil would not cause suffocation immediately.\n\nAt this time, a small surprise occurred.\n\n“Look at what I found? A trapped mermaid.” A Gu Master dragged out a mermaid corpse.\n\nHer body was covered in black oil, her appearance could not be seen, but from her build, it seemed to be a girl.\n\n“She has some life force left…” The Gu Master who saved the mermaid said with surprise.\n\n“Let me.” Fang Yuan acted.\n\nThe Gu Masters were very shocked, because they saw that the black oil moved like an obedient child, getting away from the mermaid and gathering in front of Fang Yuan as a big black ball.\n\n“Master Chu is truly unfathomable!”\n\n“Such methods, how much black oil can he get each time?”\n\nGu Masters were in admiration and envy, their respect towards Fang Yuan increased again.\n\n“Don’t worry, with me around, you will all be safe.” Fang Yuan’s action was just to reassure these people, but at the next moment, the smile on his face froze.\n\nHis sight was stuck on the mermaid’s face, he went into a daze.\n\n“Mo Er?!”\n\n_1_"
