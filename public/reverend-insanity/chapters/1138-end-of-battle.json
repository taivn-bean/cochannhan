This time, I was pretty lucky to be able to summon a chicken year beast.” Fang Yuan sized up this year beast, while appraising it inwardly.\n\nThis year beast was as large as a hill.\n\nWhen it unfurled its wings, it cast a huge shadow on the ground.\n\nIt was valiant and spirited, with awe-inspiring might. Its feathers were bright and colorful while its claws were sharp as blades.\n\nIt quickly swept its gaze around the battlefield, before fixing on Fang Yuan.\n\nNo one else had more appeal to it than Fang Yuan, because it smelled the scent of year Gu from Fang Yuan.\n\nYear Gu!\n\nThis was the food of year beasts. The higher the rank of the year Gu, the more enticing it was to year beasts.\n\nThe immortal killer move, year beast summoning, was formed from this principle. Its creator, Hei Fan, had invented this killer move long before refining Years Flow Like Water.\n\n“This is for you.” Fang Yuan chuckled, as he waved his hand, sending out large amounts of mortal year Gu.\n\nThe chicken year beast was joyous, as it raised its head and inhaled.\n\nImmediately, an enormous air current was created and like a dragon swallowing water, the chicken year beast inhaled all the mortal year Gu.\n\n“Kill it and I will give you a lot more.” Fang Yuan pointed at that crucial ancient eagle hound.\n\nThe chicken year beast’s gaze sharpened, as it quickly turned its head towards the target.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound felt goosebumps all over its body, revealing its sharp claws as it felt a strong threat from the chicken year beast.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound formed a clear contrast with the chicken year beast, even if it stood up like a human, it would not reach half the height of the chicken year beast.\n\nCluck cluck!\n\nThe chicken year beast flapped its wings, charging towards its target. The speed it erupted with was actually faster than the ancient eagle hound.\n\nBam.\n\nThe two collided fiercely, the chicken year beast was sent back seventy to eighty steps, while the ancient eagle hound was directly sent flying.\n\nThe chicken year beast let out a sharp cry, as it chased after the ancient eagle hound.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound was indeed crafty, after suffering a loss, it no longer confronted the chicken year beast head-on, instead it moved left and right, dodging the chicken year beast.\n\nFang Yuan looked on for a while before he relaxed.\n\nThis chicken year beast had no Immortal Gu, but its physical constitution was much stronger than the ancient eagle hound.\n\nYear beasts, even in the River of Time, were very rare beasts!\n\nOf course, if the ancient eagle hound activated Immortal Gu, the chicken year beast would fall into a disadvantage. Once or twice would not matter, but if it continued on, the chicken year beast would also be defeated.\n\nThe side which had Immortal Gu would naturally obtain a huge boost in their battle strength.\n\n“Hei Fan warned in the true inheritance that the summoned year beast is not a slave and the summoner does not have very much control over it. If the enemy is too powerful, it won’t battle at all. Even if it battles, it might retreat after a short period of time and demand even more year Gu from the summoning Gu Immortal.”\n\nAs he thought of this, Fang Yuan knew he did not have much time left.\n\nHe did not choose to pincer attack the ancient eagle hound with the chicken year beast.\n\nBecause the chicken year beast was not under his control and he was only able to barely communicate with it using the method left behind by Hei Fan, reaching a collaboration.\n\nFang Yuan’s true body, which was hidden amidst the myriad self army, quietly approached a desolate beast eagle hound.\n\nThe eagle hounds were still fighting with the myriad self army in the air.\n\nOccasionally, some eagle hounds would be beaten down by Fang Yuan’s strength path phantoms, but shortly afterwards, these eagle hounds would fly to the air again, continuing to fight.\n\nAlthough there were many strength path phantoms, their offensive prowess was clearly weak when facing against desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts. They were only able to disrupt and expend the eagle hounds’ energy.\n\nStrength path giant hand!\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan attacked, a strength path giant hand appeared out of nowhere, slamming down towards an eagle hound.\n\nFang Yuan’s position was extremely good, the eagle hound was caught unprepared and was struck by the hand, immediately letting out a miserable cry before it fainted.\n\nThe eagle hound began to fall down, but Fang Yuan activated another giant hand and was waiting below.\n\nThe second giant hand grabbed this unconscious eagle hound, and carefully placed it on the ground.\n\nFang Yuan’s true body disappeared amongst the myriad self army once again.\n\nBut soon, he appeared in another area of the battlefield, strength path giant hand attacked quickly and sent another eagle hound fainting.\n\nHe then did the same as before, placing this eagle hound on the ground, beside the first eagle hound.\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortals were all struck speechless!\n\n“Elder Fang Yuan seems to be…”\n\n“Right, he intends to capture these eagle hounds alive!”\n\n“A skilled person is truly courageous.”\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortals sighed. These eagle hounds, which were deadly opponents to them, seemed to be no more than wealth from Fang Yuan’s perspective.\n\nOne after the other, eagle hounds were plotted against by Fang Yuan, struck unconscious, and piled up together.\n\nSoon, these unconscious eagle hounds piled up to form a hill, making for quite a grand sight.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound saw this scene and gave a furious cry. But it was pinned down by the chicken year beast and was unable to go rescue its brethren.\n\nThe chicken year beast was also slightly in a slightly miserable state, its whole body was filled with injuries and it seemed to be having the intent to retreat.\n\nAfter all, Hei Fan was a time path Gu Immortal, being able to create an immortal killer move that imitated enslavement path was already extremely amazing.\n\n“It seems that year beast summoning is ideal for use in a favorable battle. If used to fight in a disadvantageous situation during a life or death battle, the result won’t be outstanding.” Fang Yuan engraved this information in his mind. Only when one used immortal killer moves in practice would they obtain deeper experience.\n\nFang Yuan firmly held the initiative in the battle.\n\nHe paid attention to the battle between the chicken year beast and the ancient eagle hound all along.\n\nBefore the chicken year beast retreated, Fang Yuan dealt with the remaining eagle hounds.\n\nThe unconscious eagle hounds numbered to eight, while the rest were struck to death. After all, giant hand was not a capturing method, it was not easy for Fang Yuan to use it to imitate this effect.\n\n“Die!”\n\nFang Yuan flew to the sky and flanked the ancient eagle hound with the chicken year beast.\n\nAfter fighting for several rounds, the result was indeed not good.\n\nFang Yuan called out to the chicken year beast to retreat and guard those unconscious eagle hounds.\n\nThe chicken year beast already had low battle intent, and after receiving Fang Yuan’s instruction, it did not immediately move, but instead quietly retreated a distance before opening its beak as it gazed at Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan understood its intention, and threw out a large batch of year Gu.\n\nThe chicken year beast had its fill, only then did it turn around and move towards the ground, to guard the unconscious eagle hounds.\n\nFang Yuan and the ancient eagle hound battled once again.\n\nBut this time, the situation was different from before.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound was anxious to save those unconscious comrades, as it charged in all directions.\n\n“What a pity. A grand Gu Immortal falling down to such a level! Thinking it is an actual eagle hound.” Fang Yuan was lot more relaxed now than before.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound flew fast and with Immortal Gu on it, at the crucial times, it could arouse its survival instincts and activate the previous immortal killer move.\n\nFang Yuan changed his battle tactic.\n\nHis previous tactic of charging in and using giant hand was too risky. Bloodstained conqueror’s robe’s defense was nothing prominent in front of this ancient eagle hound.\n\nFang Yuan started using sword path killer moves to attack the ancient eagle hound from afar.\n\nBut the ancient eagle hound’s defensive method was outstanding, Fang Yuan did not know which Immortal Gu it was specifically. He estimated this transformation path Gu Immortal, when alive, felt the defense of an eagle hound was rather low, thus intentionally strengthening this aspect.\n\nFang Yuan fought for a long time but still had no upper hand, the ancient eagle hound also could not rescue its comrades, while the chicken year beast sat in position to fight a defensive battle.\n\nThe injuries on the ancient eagle hound slowly accumulated.\n\n“This is truly troublesome. Giant hand’s speed is slow, it cannot hit. Sword path killer moves can hit, but the effect is not that good. Using poison spit is simply wasting immortal essence. Ancient eagle hounds are extremely resistant to poison!”\n\nFang Yuan was without other options.\n\nSimilarly, after this transformation path Gu Immortal completely transformed into the ancient eagle hound, they obtained the intuition of wild beasts, and with the remaining battle instincts, this ancient eagle hound became much more difficult to handle.\n\nFacing it, Fang Yuan found himself at a loss as to what to do.\n\nA transformation path Gu Immortal’s advantage was that after the transformation succeeds, their body’s constitution would be extremely high. Like this ancient eagle hound, just its flying speed could match Sword Escape in short range. Let alone when it activates its Immortal Gu.\n\nAt the moment, Fang Yuan could only choose to fight a battle of attrition.\n\nWhen this ancient eagle hound uses up all its immortal essence, and is no longer able to activate its Immortal Gu, that would be his victory.\n\nOr when its injuries accumulate to a certain degree and it exposes a flaw which Fang Yuan could use!\n\nFang Yuan felt helpless, but the spectators did not have this feeling.\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortals were staring blankly.\n\nStrength!\n\nIn the competitive, cruel world of Gu Immortals, the most important thing was the Gu Immortal’s strength.\n\nThe strength Fang Yuan displayed shocked all the hairy men.\n\nEven Sixth Hair was not an exception.\n\n“This guy, how could he increase his battle strength so much in such a short time?! He can actually summon a year beast, how did he get a hold of this method? He clearly only went out for a short period of time…”\n\nSixth Hair felt heaviness in his mind.\n\nFang Yuan’s growth speed caused him to feel stifled and breathless.\n\nAfter some more time fighting, the ancient eagle hound suddenly rose up.\n\n“Eh? You want to escape!” Fang Yuan thought before quickly giving chase.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound’s injuries had accumulated to a certain state, whether it be its offensive prowess or flying speed, both had clearly fallen.\n\nNo matter how talented in battle the Gu Immortal was when they were alive, the wild beast’s instinct of evading danger still made it choose to retreat.\n\nAs for those unconscious ‘comrades’, they could only be abandoned.\n\nFang Yuan inwardly cursed at this, he had already anticipated this situation, it was just that it happened earlier than his expectation.\n\nFang Yuan activated sword escape Immortal Gu to give chase, but the distance between them was shrinking very slowly.\n\nThe ancient eagle hound was escaping for its life with an astonishing speed.\n\nImmortal killer move — Luck Whirlwind!\n\nFang Yuan was without other options and could only activate this killer move.\n\nSuccess!\n\nThe ancient eagle hound directly returned to the previous position, Fang Yuan caught up to it and both sides engaged in fierce battle again.\n\nAfter a few rounds of fighting, the ancient eagle hound escaped again.\n\nFang Yuan could only give chase.\n\nLuck whirlwind!\n\nSuccess.\n\nBoth sides battled again, while the hairy man Gu Immortals watched on from afar.\n\nBut soon, the ancient eagle hound gave up on Fang Yuan, it crazily flapped its wings as it retreated for a third time, its attitude more firm than before.\n\nFang Yuan was helpless, he was unable to break the eagle’s wings.\n\nLuck whirlwind!\n\nUnfortunately, he failed this time and immediately spurted out some blood.\n\nIt took him a few breaths to stabilize himself, the ancient eagle hound had already flown to the horizon by this time.\n\nFang Yuan had no choice but to stop.\n\nHeaven’s will was paying attention all along, Tai Qiu was perilous, and there were already vague signs of a beast tide forming."
