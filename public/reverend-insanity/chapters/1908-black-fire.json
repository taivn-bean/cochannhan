  "content": "Non-conflicting dao marks!\n\nThe sovereign immortal body’s greatest advantage was also its greatest weakness, at this moment, it was fully exposed.\n\nAll along, Fang Yuan had been consciously avoiding this flaw, but Shen Shang’s killer move was too peculiar, it could not be guarded against.\n\nWho could have thought that night song killer move was just a trap?\n\nShen Shang was chased by Myriad Year Flying Warship, it was a normal thing to use this killer move to conceal his own traces.\n\nIf Fang Yuan did not use an investigative method, Shen Shang would hide within the darkness, he would not be able to do anything.\n\nThe human path dao marks on Fang Yuan’s injuries grew rapidly!\n\nThe light injuries on Shen Shang’s body also affected Fang Yuan due to the killer move mutual injuries.\n\nAnd in Fang Yuan’s case, because of non-conflicting dao marks, his light injuries became heavy injuries.\n\nBut thankfully, all sorts of healing killer moves had their full effect when used on Fang Yuan as well.\n\nThus, as he used a powerful healing method on himself, Fang Yuan instantly recovered.\n\nImmortal killer move — Heavy Injuries!\n\nShen Shang snickered as he started to hurt himself, with greater intensity than before.\n\nFang Yuan’s body shook intensely, his vision turned dark as his seven orifices started to bleed.\n\n“No! In terms of healing methods, I cannot compare to Shen Shang, I need to find another way.” Fang Yuan understood as determination flashed in his eyes.\n\nImmortal killer move — Heavy Injuries!\n\nImmortal killer move — Heavy Injuries!\n\nImmortal killer move — Heavy Injuries!\n\nShen Shang continued to injury himself as he turned crazy, he laughed loudly as blood spewed out of his mouth.\n\nHe heavily injured himself but rapidly healed as well, continuing the cycle.\n\nThis was such a strange fighting style, it made all the Gu Immortals dumbfounded.\n\nMiao Ming Shen and the rest had nervous expressions, they were very worried.\n\nShen clan’s Gu Immortals were very excited.\n\nEven though they could not see Fang Yuan’s condition, his flying swords had disintegrated while Myriad Year Flying Warship continued to back off.\n\n“Ancestor Shen Shang actually forced back Fang Yuan! Impressive.” Shen Cong Sheng was very excited, he could also see the rise of Shen clan.\n\nMiao Ming Shen’s eyes shined with bright light as he thought to himself: “Not good, even though Fang Yuan has Myriad Year Flying Warship, Shen Shang’s offensive methods bypass this Immortal Gu House, it counters Fang Yuan. He is just a rank seven after all while Shen Shang is a genuine rank eight Gu Immortal.”\n\nGui Qi Ye and Tu Tou Tuo were very confused: “This Shen Shang was suppressed by Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable back then, it is not normal that he could live for so long.”\n\n“And the strange thing is, he does not lack Immortal Gu! When Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable suppressed him, didn’t he take away or destroy his Immortal Gu first?”\n\n“Ugh!” Right at this moment, Shen Shang’s wild laughter came to an abrupt stop.\n\nSurprise and confusion appeared on his face.\n\nHis connection to Fang Yuan was weakening rapidly.\n\nHow did Fang Yuan do it?\n\nHow could he break and get around this method so quickly?!\n\nImmortal killer move — Self Cleansing!\n\nSelf cleansing could eliminate harmful dao marks on the user’s body, Fang Yuan used this killer move to quickly get rid of the human path dao marks on his body.\n\nThe blood red light in Shen Shang’s eyes flickered, he started to mutilate himself even more intensely, causing the human path dao marks on Fang Yuan’s body to grow rapidly.\n\nAs long as a single human path dao mark remained on Fang Yuan’s body, he could use this connection to attack Fang Yuan while bypassing Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nBut right now, Fang Yuan had already stabilized the situation.\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship gradually flew closer as Fang Yuan’s voice resounded from within: “It is my turn now, Shen Shang.”\n\nTwelve Zodiac ancient battle formation!\n\nBam.\n\nWith a loud sound, the huge grey stone giant appeared again.\n\nThe giant moved extremely quickly, its two hands grabbed towards Shen Shang as they spread open.\n\nShen Shang squinted and snorted coldly, he quickly retreated, attempting to pull some distance from the giant.\n\nUnder Fang Yuan’s manipulation, the grey stone giant only attempted to capture Shen Shang, it did not attack fiercely.\n\nThe grey stone giant had very powerful offensive methods, even though this was not the River of Time, it still had peak rank eight strength.\n\nBut he was currently using capture as the objective instead of hurting Shen Shang, Shen Shang had no choice but to dodge.\n\nThe battle went into a deadlock.\n\nShen Shang dodged the Twelve Zodiac battle formation while using killer moves to mutilate himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Fang Yuan manipulated Myriad Year Flying Warship as he healed himself, using self cleansing to get rid of harmful human path dao marks.\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship and the grey stone giant worked together, chasing after Shen Shang and obstructing him.\n\nShen Shang was already having some trouble dodging Myriad Year Flying Warship, with the addition of the grey stone giant, he fell into a disadvantage.\n\nEvery time he was about to get caught, Shen Shang would emit a loud scream that caused sound waves to burst out, opening a path for him.\n\nBoth sides continued to fight, rampaging in the battlefield, it implicated Miao Ming Shen’s group, as well as the Shen clan immortals.\n\nHua Die and Feng Jiang were first to give up, they were transported away from the battlefield.\n\nFollowed by Tong Hua, Tu Tou Tuo, Gui Qi Ye and the rest.\n\nAfter that were Shen clan’s immortals, Miao Ming Shen, and Ren Xiu Ping.\n\nEventually, only Shen Cong Sheng was left in the battlefield, not everyone was qualified to watch a battle between rank eights after all.\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s expression became increasingly dark.\n\nThe battle was tilting in Fang Yuan’s favor, Shen Shang was getting into a difficult spot while Fang Yuan was having an easier time now.\n\n“This lad has deep wisdom path attainment, he has countless thoughts in his mind, he can multitask easily. In this aspect, I am at the losing end.” Shen Shang gritted his teeth, at this point in the battle, he felt like he had fallen into a swamp, the more he struggled, the deeper he sank.\n\nThe battle had already left his control!\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan walked out of the cabin, arriving at the bow of the ship.\n\nHe pointed at Shen Shang as a time path killer move was unleashed.\n\nShen Shang was caught off guard, he could not dodge, after getting hit by this move, his movement slowed, the rate of time on him had been halved.\n\nThe grey stone giant used this chance to grab Shen Shang, it squeezed.\n\nShen Shang laughed loudly, his hair was messy and his eyes were bloodshot, he had no fear: “Go ahead and kill me!”\n\nFang Yuan snorted, he ordered the grey stone giant, it gripped to form a cage of ten fingers, imprisoning Shen Shang and preventing him from moving.\n\nAfter understanding Shen Shang’s offensive methods, Fang Yuan easily countered it. As long as he was captured and not killed, he could not do anything to harm Fang Yuan.\n\nShen Shang struggled, he screamed wildly but could not escape.\n\nShen Cong Sheng saw that the situation was bad, he wanted to help but was quickly faced with backlash, he could not get away from Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s restrictions.\n\n“I finally succeeded.” Fang Yuan let out a breath of air.\n\nShen Shang lived up to his reputation, this person who was suppressed by Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable personally really had some skills.\n\nHis methods were peculiar and strange, they were hard to guard against, Fang Yuan had fallen for them earlier.\n\nOf course, Fang Yuan still controlled the situation without wasting many of his hidden trump cards.\n\nIn the worst case, Fang Yuan could return to the starting island, with this assurance, he could not lose to begin with.\n\n“Ahhhh….” Shen Shang shouted loudly, his face was distorted.\n\nFang Yuan’s brows slowly started to furrow.\n\nShen Shang’s current situation was quite strange, he constantly laughed and struggled madly without using any immortal killer moves.\n\nAt the next moment, his bloodshot eyes turned pitch black, the black color spread until it filled his eyes.\n\nWith a light sound, a lump of black fire started to burn on his body.\n\nWithin the fire, Shen Shang’s body shook like he was having a spasm, he drooled uncontrollably as he waved his limbs around, he growled like a wild beast that was out of control.\n\nThe black fire on Shen Shang’s body was not eye-catching, but once it spread to the grey stone giant’s hands, the giant screamed in pain as it got burned by the fire.\n\nAfter both hands got into contact with the black fire, they started to melt, completely defenseless against this strange black fire.\n\nFang Yuan’s gaze turned colder, the peculiarity and strength of this black fire was far beyond his imagination.\n\nSeeing that the situation was bad, Fang Yuan quickly deactivated the ancient battle formation.\n\nAt the next moment, the grey stone giant vanished while twelve immemorial year beasts appeared in the sky.\n\nAmong them, two immemorial year beasts contacted the black fire and lost their reasoning, they rolled around in the sky, growling in pain as they struggled intensely.\n\nThankfully, the other ten immemorial year beasts acted like this was their biggest threat, after regaining freedom, they quickly fled from the black fire as far as they could.\n\nFang Yuan and Shen Cong Sheng frowned deeply with solemn expressions.\n\nThis black fire was too strange, the two of them could not tell what path this black fire belonged to!\n\nAt the same time, they felt an extreme feeling of threat, their skulls felt numb as they sensed this danger.\n\nThe black fire was like the enemy of all lifeforms!\n\nThe two immemorial year beasts were already covered in the fire, they growled as they fell to the ground.\n\nFang Yuan had a strong premonition, if these two immemorial year beasts fell into the seawater, the black fire would cause an even greater tragedy.\n\nBut he did not do anything, he went into Myriad Year Flying Warship and retreated.\n\nShen Shang who had lost the restriction of the grey stone giant floated in the air and laughed wildly like a lunatic.\n\nShen Cong Sheng called him several times but it went unheard. Seeing this strange situation, Shen Cong Sheng also wisely chose to retreat.\n\nRight when those two immemorial year beasts were about to enter the water, a golden-white pillar of light shot out from the underwater formation, pushing these two immemorial year beasts up into the sky.\n\nThe underwater formation that had only forty percent left burst out with unprecedented power as it operated at full force!\n\nThe golden-white light expanded as it covered Shen Shang as well.\n\nThe black fire continued to burn Shen Shang and the two immemorial year beasts but the white-gold light pillar immobilized them on the spot.\n\nSuch a change caused Shen Cong Sheng to be stunned.\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan made his move, daybreak flying swords flew out and pierced the white-gold light pillar, stabbing into Shen Shang.\n\n“Stop it!” Watching that his ancestor was attacked by Fang Yuan, Shen Cong Sheng shouted anxiously.\n\nFang Yuan smiled coldly as he activated his flying swords with even greater intensity.\n\nThis odd black fire was very harmful, seeing that the underwater formation had taken action to stop it from even entering the sea, it was obvious.\n\nShen Cong Sheng could only watch helplessly.\n\nFang Yuan willed again as his flying swords split into two groups, the other group went to attack his immemorial year beasts.\n\nDue to the attack of the daybreak flying swords, the black fire still burned but it had weakened by a very slight amount.\n\nDaybreak sword was a rank eight killer move, yet it nearly had no effect!\n\nFang Yuan continued to attack, but the black fire suddenly changed, transforming into lumps of silver-white mist."
