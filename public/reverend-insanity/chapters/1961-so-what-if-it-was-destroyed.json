  "content": "The moment fate Gu was destroyed, the whole battlefield returned to its previous state.\n\nThe white light formed by fate vanquish killer move disappeared completely.\n\nCrack crack.\n\nA series of crisp sounds echoed as countless cracks spread throughout Heaven Overseeing Tower. At the next moment, the whole of Heaven Overseeing Tower crumbled into pieces!\n\nThe grand Heavenly Court fell into deathly silence.\n\nThere was no trace of wind in the battlefield, but the immortals felt a hurricane blowing in their hearts!\n\nHeaven Overseeing Tower turned into countless fragments that fell down along with Gu Immortal corpses. Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable’s painting path method turned into a ray of light that crossed the sky and flew far away.\n\nFang Yuan ignored it and quietly floated in the air, looking at Duke Long, Feng Jiu Ge, and the rest.\n\nHe had no expression and did not say anything, he only opened his palm slowly. Under everybody’s vision killer move, everyone in the five regions saw — the fragments of the destroyed fate Gu!\n\n“Fate Gu has been… destroyed?”\n\n“We won?!”\n\nThe three regions’ Gu Immortals looked at each other, seeing the astonishment and daze on each other’s faces.\n\n“Unbelievable, we really did it!”\n\n“This battle will definitely be remembered by later generations.”\n\nAfter coming to their senses, the three regions’ Gu Immortals cheered wildly!\n\nOn the contrary, Heavenly Court’s remaining Gu Immortals had ashen expressions and were dazed like puppets.\n\nFate Gu was Heavenly Court’s banner, their spiritual pillar.\n\nIt was more than a rank nine Gu worm, Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable had relied on this Gu to create the rule of humanity, it gave humans the hope of freedom and courage to revolt.\n\nAfter over three million years of inheritance and development, the significance of fate Gu was much greater to Heavenly Court. It was Heavenly Court’s foundation, a symbol, and also an eternally fluttering banner.\n\nBut now, this banner was taken down and torn by Fang Yuan!\n\nHeavenly Court’s immortals felt that the pillar in their mind was taken away, their world had collapsed!\n\nEven without the three regions’ Gu Immortals attacking or any external stimulation, they were dazed and did not know what they should do.\n\nEven Feng Jiu Ge was silent, his destiny song that had kept on resounding throughout the battlefield stopped at this moment.\n\nFar away, Feng Jin Huang was hiding in a secret underground Immortal Gu House, she was weeping silently: “Fate Gu… has been destroyed! How did this happen? Everyone clearly put in so much effort, not even hesitating to sacrifice themselves!”\n\nQin Ding Ling’s gaze was blank, she was like a lifeless statue.\n\nThe greatly damaged Demon Judgment Board rose to the sky, Fang Zheng who was inside looked at Fang Yuan with a highly complicated expression: “Fang Yuan, you actually accomplished it. In Heavenly Court, in front of the venerable methods, you destroyed fate Gu! So the gap between you and I is simply this big.”\n\nThis gap made Fang Zheng feel despair, but a strange thing was Fang Zheng did not feel bitterness at this moment, instead he felt a trace of relief.\n\nIt was time to give up.\n\nA person like Fang Yuan was different from everyone from the start. Thinking of rivaling him was wishful thinking from the start, a delirious thought even.\n\n“Damn it, damn it…”\n\n“We failed, fate Gu has been destroyed.”\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals cried. They had used all their strength, given their everything, some crawled out of their graves to fight, some held on till the end, but they still failed.\n\n“We have really failed our comrades who sacrificed themselves!”\n\n“I am too ashamed to face my seniors!”\n\nShame surfaced on the Heavenly Court immortals’ faces, many even had the impulse to kill themselves.\n\n“Don’t panic!” At this moment, Duke Long suddenly spoke, his voice spreading throughout the battlefield, shaking every Gu Immortal’s mind.\n\nDuke Long flew to the sky, his expression was solemn as he knew this was the crucial moment.\n\nFate Gu had been destroyed, Duke Long could not afford to be upset or blame himself. He was the leader of Heavenly Court, he needed to try his hardest to deal with this issue!\n\nWhat made him anxious was that even the deeply experienced Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were shaken like this. What would the people all over the world think about this sight?\n\nIf Fang Yuan scheming and defeating Heavenly Court time and again earlier was like a heavy slap to Heavenly Court’s face, then Fang Yuan destroying fate Gu was like shaking Heavenly Court’s foundation completely, destroying the status and reputation Heavenly Court had accumulated for over three million years!\n\nDuke Long had to restore their morale and fighting spirit.\n\n“Fang Yuan, you really think you destroyed fate Gu?” Duke Long suddenly laughed with no trace of listlessness, one could not sense any form of wavering in his tone.\n\nFang Yuan did not reply and only slightly raised his hand as he looked at Duke Long.\n\nImmediately, the three regions’ Gu Immortals ridiculed: “Duke Long, have you gone blind? You can’t see the fragments of fate Gu?”\n\nSome of the Heavenly Court Gu Immortals looked with bright gazes, a spark of hope rising in their hearts: “Is the fate Gu that Fang Yuan destroyed a replica?”\n\nBut Duke Long shook his head, still laughing: “Hehehe, the destroyed fate Gu is the real one. But Fang Yuan, even though fate Gu is destroyed, has it really been destroyed forever, can we not refine it once again?”\n\n“Huh?” The immortals were stupefied.\n\nImmortal Gu were unique, this was an irrefutable truth of the world. If I had an Immortal Gu, others could not possess the same one.\n\nBut when this Immortal Gu was destroyed, others would have the chance to possess it.\n\nFate Gu was destroyed by Fang Yuan now, this was an ironclad truth. But this was not a genuine ending because Heavenly Court could refine it again!\n\n“Does Heavenly Court have fate Gu’s recipe?” Shen Cong Sheng’s expression was grim as he asked.\n\n“Heavenly Court has held fate Gu for over three million years, we had countless refinement path great experts and three Immortal Venerables in this period. Take a guess if our Heavenly Court has fate Gu’s recipe or not?” Duke Long smiled, his entire body letting out confidence and calmness.\n\n“Damn it!” The three regions’ Gu Immortals were exasperated.\n\nDuke Long laughed: “However, even if Heavenly Court did not have fate Gu’s Immortal Gu recipe, so what? Everyone, let me ask you, was the fate Gu in the Immemorial Antiquity Era refined by Ren Zu?”\n\n“Of course not.” Qin Ding Ling replied, she understood Duke Long’s intention and her eyes shone with life again: “Fate Gu was born from heaven and earth itself.”\n\nDuke Long nodded: “That’s right, Immortal Gu are born from nature which is why there are many wild Immortal Gu. Even if we cannot refine it, heaven and earth will refine fate Gu. The new fate Gu might be rank six or even rank nine directly. Who can say for sure?”\n\nThis time, the three regions’ Gu Immortals looked at each other.\n\nAfter Duke Long mentioned this point, they suddenly realized that destroying fate Gu might not be a big deal!\n\nIf fate Gu was destroyed, so be it, it could be refined again.\n\n“Even if it is refined, we can destroy it again!” A Gu Immortal shouted angrily, but even he himself did not have much confidence.\n\nTo destroy fate Gu this time, they had paid a huge price! Could such success really be replicated? Forget about anything else, just the point that only an otherworldly demon could destroy fate Gu blocked the path of many heroes and conquerors. Didn’t even three Demon Venerables fail?\n\n“Damn it, how could we have failed to notice this?” A Gu Immortal was vexed, but thinking about it, he could blame himself for not considering everything properly.\n\nAfter all, invading Heavenly Court and destroying fate Gu was already an enormous goal and could even be said to be wishful thinking. To realize this goal, the Gu Immortals had already exhausted their minds and energy. This was an impossible mission akin to a mortal ascending to heaven, even if they used all their strength and had inexhaustible will, it was still difficult to achieve.\n\nUnder such circumstances, who could afford to think of the matter after ascending to heaven?\n\nIn fact, when Central Continent held the Refinement Path Convention and four regions’ Gu Immortals invaded, who could say for sure that they could destroy fate Gu?\n\nNo one!\n\nEven Fang Yuan, even venerables did not have such confidence.\n\nEveryone was giving it a try.\n\nAfter the attempt succeeded, the Gu Immortals were exulted. But what happens after realizing this goal?\n\nDuke Long’s words were also the truth. The three regions’ Gu Immortals suddenly discovered that the price they paid, the battles and the effort they invested were all in vain, was it just an empty victory?\n\nThe three regions’ Gu Immortals were silent, their expressions gradually turning unsightly.\n\nWu Yong was sharp and sensed the change in people’s hearts and the fallen morale, he immediately refuted coldly: “Lord Duke Long, you have a sharp tongue. However, Heavenly Court’s failure is still a failure, you took great pain to defend and even hide fate Gu in Heavenly Court, yet we were still able to destroy it. In the future, even if you obtain fate Gu again, so what?”\n\n“Hehehe, in fact, you need to be careful. Otherwise, when heaven and earth gives birth to the new fate Gu, you won’t be able to refine it yourselves. At that time, fate Gu will become a wild Immortal Gu, anyone will be able to possess it, it might not necessarily be obtained by your Heavenly Court anymore.”\n\nThe three regions’ immortals’ eyes brightened and their morale soared.\n\nDuke Long was smiling calmly: “Wu Yong, you are not wrong about it at all. Let’s say fate Gu becomes a wild Immortal Gu and is obtained by one of you, so what? Can you all… use it? Do you know how to use it?”\n\nEven Wu Yong could not reply to this question.\n\nDuke Long smiled proudly: “Fate Gu can never be used by Gu Immortals! Before the Remote Antiquity Era, it was held by variant humans but they could not use it. Over three million years, my Heavenly Court had several Immortal Venerables, but no one could directly use this Gu. Countless geniuses racked their minds and then conceptualized Heaven Overseeing Tower, it took three million years for us to research a killer move that could make use of fate Gu, and that is fate vanquish!”\n\n“Do you understand the killer move fate vanquish? Do you know how to construct Heaven Overseeing Tower?”\n\nThe three regions’ Gu Immortals fell into silence.\n\nDuke Long continued: “Only heaven’s will can use fate Gu. Back then, for the sake of humanity, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not hesitate to sacrifice herself and merged with heaven’s will, disturbing and influencing heaven’s will. Which is why, humanity that rose three million years ago is still flourishing now, we remained as the rulers of the world.”\n\n“And my Heavenly Court built the immortal graveyard to support Star Constellation’s will. Heavenly Court members all chose to hibernate in the immortal graveyard to provide constant help for Star Constellation’s will. Only then are we able to influence fate Gu and thus influence the position of humanity in the whole world!”\n\n“Among you, who can achieve this?”\n\nDuke Long swept his gaze throughout the battlefield, the three regions’ Gu Immortals were silent while Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals stood proudly, someone even added arrogantly: “No one! In the vast five regions, only Heavenly Court can accomplish this!”\n\n“No, you are wrong, Duke Long.” Bing Sai Chuan’s retort came from inside Calamity Luck Altar: “Even if we are unable to use fate Gu, we can use it as a Gu refinement material to refine destiny Gu! Fate Gu cannot be controlled by others, but destiny Gu can. This is the plan of our Lord Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.”\n\nDuke Long looked towards Calamity Luck Altar and gave a disdainful smile: “Even if you refine destiny Gu, does it mean fate Gu won’t exist?”\n\nBing Sai Chuan was unable to reply.\n\nIf fate Gu was used as a Gu material, when Longevity Heaven refined destiny Gu, fate Gu would be used up. In the future, there could still be a new fate Gu.\n\nDuke Long sighed: “No matter what you do, fate Gu will still exist. Even if it destroyed now, it will appear again in the future. As long as it appears, will your efforts today have any meaning?”\n\nThe three regions’ Gu Immortals were silent.\n\n“Of course there is meaning!” Duke Long answered himself with solemness and hatred: “The meaning of this is to give a chance for variant humans to rise up, for them to create an unimaginably bad influence on humanity.”\n\n“You cannot use fate Gu and how long will it take for you to refine destiny Gu? You don’t even have an incomplete Gu recipe of fate Gu! Once fate Gu reappears, it will be controlled by heaven’s will. Humanity will decline and variant humans will rise.”\n\n“And the one who led to this is all of you!” Duke Long berated and suddenly pointed towards Fang Yuan: “Especially you! You are the greatest evil! You destroyed the immortal graveyard, Star Constellation’s will won’t be able to interfere with heaven’s will like before. If humanity is exterminated in the future, you will be the main culprit behind everything!!”\n\n“Fang Yuan, oh Fang Yuan, you think you obtained victory by destroying fate Gu?”\n\n“Hehehe, at best, this is only a giant joke.”\n\n“My Heavenly Court thinks for humanity in all aspects, we offered our blood and sweat for the benefits of humanity, even sacrificing ourselves. And you people, for your own selfish interests, destroyed the great position that my Heavenly Court had maintained meticulously for millions of years.”\n\n“My Heavenly Court can refine fate Gu again in the future, we can refine it secretly! We won’t let the five regions know of fate Gu’s refinement, will you find out about it?”\n\n“Can you all stop us in time?”\n\n“Even if you stop us the second or the third time. What about after that? Who can guarantee you can stop us from refining it again and again?”\n\n“We will only refine rank six fate Gu, it is far easier than restoring it to rank nine!”\n\n“Also, every time we fight because of fate Gu, humanity will suffer heavy losses and greatly expend its foundation. This will give variant humans the opportunity to rise up against us!”\n\nDuke Long lamented with deep emotions as he said this.\n\n“Who is this old man? I did not know that Heavenly Court did so many things in consideration for our entire human race!”\n\n“Why did they invade Heavenly Court, what were these Gu Immortals thinking?”\n\n“These people are all demons, they disregarded the big picture for their own interests! They are accursed sinners!”\n\nThe five regions’ mortals resonated with Duke Long.\n\nMost of the mortals had extremely little understanding of the Gu Immortal world.\n\nAnd the Gu Immortals scattered in the five regions were also silent when they heard Duke Long.\n\nHeavenly Court was powerful, Heavenly Court was domineering, Heavenly Court occupied almost all the cultivation resources of Central Continent, Heavenly Court’s ambition stretched extremely far and actively interfered in major events of the other four regions.\n\nBut no one was able to deny Heavenly Court’s contribution in protecting humanity.\n\nThis was a fact!\n\n“Ahhh, this is somewhat troublesome. Although it felt extremely satisfying to destroy fate Gu, there is some emptiness after the adrenaline rush, this is a bit of a problem.” Inside the blood cape, Reckless Savage’s will mumbled while holding his head.\n\n“Hehe, Duke Long, are you done?” Fang Yuan’s expression was indifferent, after destroying fate Gu, this was the first time he spoke and broke the silence.\n\nDuke Long looked at Fang Yuan, his brows furrowed as he started feeling uneasy.\n\nFang Yuan was too calm! According to Fang Yuan’s intelligence, how could he not see the crucial point? Duke Long tried to think from another perspective, if he were Fang Yuan, he would definitely use all his strength to attack and not give the enemies the chance to speak.\n\nBecause once Duke Long spoke, he would create this current situation.\n\nIndeed.\n\nDuke Long’s words restored Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals’ morale and also suppressed the enemies’ spirit, he also raised Heavenly Court’s prestige and it was simply turning the situation around!\n\nDuke Long was worthy of being the leader of Heavenly Court, he not only possessed terrifying strength worthy of the main pillar, at the crucial time, he could even lead and boost morale, changing people’s hearts.\n\nHow could Fang Yuan not see this?\n\nBut he did not stop Duke Long, Duke Long could even vaguely see a trace of anticipation in his eyes.\n\nSo what was Fang Yuan anticipating?\n\nAt the next moment, Fang Yuan chuckled: “Oh Duke Long, who told you that destroying fate Gu meant the end of this battle? You seem to have forgotten someone.”\n\nDuke Long’s pupils shrank as he realized something.\n\nHe followed Fang Yuan’s gaze and saw a river.\n\nThat was a phantom silhouette of the River of Time!\n\nCalamity Luck Altar carried Red Lotus Demon Venerable’s method — Call of the Ancient. From the start of the battle, this killer move’s power had condensed into a phantom River of Time in Heavenly Court.\n\nNorthern Plains’ past Gu Immortal experts walked out from this phantom river and created an extremely huge threat to Heavenly Court.\n\nBut as the battle continued, the phantom River of Time seemed to have gradually grown powerless as fewer and fewer of Northern Plains’ experts were summoned.\n\nAt the late stage of the battle, this phantom River of Time seemed to be motionless and showed no traces of new figures emerging.\n\nHowever, when Fang Yuan destroyed fate Gu, this phantom River of Time seemed like a beast that had broken free of its shackles, it started surging wildly and turbulently.\n\nSwish swish swish…\n\nThe river water surged, raising astonishing waves.\n\nA figure walked out slowly and naturally from the giant waves.\n\nAll the immortals present heard his voice:\n\n“In my youth I shined in the light of spring, horses trampled on flowers as fragrance of wine spread.\n\nLove and hatred came with the waves, summer cicadas sang as I woke up in the middle of the night.\n\nPlanting red lotuses in the River of Time, going back in time with my tears run dry.\n\nThrough the vicissitudes of life I return to this stage, the myriad beings anticipate a life unbound by fate!”\n\nHe had the appearance of a young man, his gaze seemed to have experienced countless vicissitudes, he wore a red robe, his face was pure as jade, his eyes were bright like stars, and his skin was white as snow.\n\nHe walked out from the phantom River of Time and stepped into Heavenly Court’s battlefield.\n\nEveryone watched, there was complete silence all around.\n\nHis gaze moved around before fixing on Duke Long’s body.\n\nDuke Long shook, his expression was extremely complicated as he opened his mouth, his lips moved but no words came out.\n\nThe young man smiled: “Master, have you been well?”"
