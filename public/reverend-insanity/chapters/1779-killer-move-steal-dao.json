  "content": "Chapter 1779 Killer Move Steal Dao\n\nSuan Bu Jin was just a disguise, Fang Yuan knew that in order to join Fang clan, his biggest obstacle was Fang Di Chang.\n\nBecause he was a wisdom path great grandmaster.\n\nUsually, only experts among rank eights had great grandmaster attainment level, they were hard to deal with.\n\nThere would be too many traces left behind if Fang Yuan tried to use wisdom path methods to deal with Fang Di Chang’s deductions. After all, Fang Yuan was just a wisdom path grandmaster, he was skilled at deductions and killer move modification in terms of wisdom path.\n\nUsing the light of wisdom, in terms of deducing killer moves, he was the number one person in the world.\n\nBut dealing with other Gu Immortals and resisting other wisdom path Gu Immortals’ deductions was not Fang Yuan’s expertise.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan joins Fang clan, it might stir some strange feelings in Fang Di Chang.\n\nWisdom path Gu Immortals were usually very calm, if their mental state was affected and their emotions changed, it would signify a huge problem.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan arranged for Ying Wu Xie to disguise as a Western Desert Gu Immortal and attack Fang clan’s heavenly dew oasis.\n\nAs expected, Fang Di Chang fell for it and did not suspect Fang Yuan.\n\nMaking Ying Wu Xie attack heavenly dew oasis had another deeper meaning.\n\nIt was to help Fang Yuan ‘integrate’ into Fang clan more quickly.\n\nSuan Bu Jin had worked with Fang clan to fight over Divine Bean Palace, but he had just joined the clan, Western Desert’s righteous path was not familiar with him, while Fang clan held suspicion towards his loyalty.\n\nAt this time, Fang Yuan arranged for such an event, he displayed his own battle strength and to a certain extent, his loyalty towards Fang clan.\n\n“However… Fang Di Chang’s wisdom path attainment level is higher than mine, the more we interact, the more likely he would be to find out the truth.” Fang Yuan alerted himself.\n\nDealing with a wisdom path great grandmaster was too troublesome!\n\nEven though Fang Yuan was using familiar face killer move, he was in danger of getting exposed.\n\nOther than that, there was another risk: Ying Wu Xie.\n\nYing Wu Xie’s disguise method was not special, after all soul path did not specialize in that. Furthermore, legendary immemorial soul beast Qing Chou was likely still lurking somewhere in green ghost desert.\n\nThese were all hidden dangers and risks.\n\nBut compared to these risks, Fang Yuan’s need for a vast number of soul beasts to raise his soul path cultivation level was greater.\n\nHe was willing to take the risk!\n\n“Even though I joined Fang clan and they agreed to develop green ghost desert, giving me a portion of the soul cores once in a while, they are very busy now and because they have some stockpile of soul cores, they will likely hand me these accumulated soul cores during this period of time.”\n\nFang Yuan had already expected this, he needed to rely on himself for the development of green ghost desert.\n\nFang Yuan had not thought of relying on Fang clan to capture soul beasts for him. In that situation, Fang clan would not try their best after all.\n\nThe truth was, Fang Yuan did not want Fang clan to overly take control of green ghost desert.\n\nThe cooperation with them was to prevent Fang clan from causing trouble. After all, there was only one clan, Fang clan, around the vicinity of green ghost desert.\n\nFang Yuan could not station himself in green ghost desert, he had to arrange pawns like Ying Wu Xie. If Fang clan found trouble with him, they could not deal with Fang Yuan easily, but Ying Wu Xie was an easy target.\n\nFang Yuan had considered many things.\n\nIn this case, he had to cooperate with Fang clan first.\n\nEven though Fang clan did not have effective methods to use the soul beasts, they would capture many soul beasts each year and extract their soul cores, it could build up their inventory and also be sold for profit.\n\nIf Fang Yuan tried to hunt in green ghost desert alone using Suan Bu Jin’s identity, Fang clan would find him an eyesore.\n\nAs the super force that was the closest to green ghost desert, Fang clan had already treated green ghost desert as their own territory.\n\nFang Yuan could not eliminate them entirely, he had to choose to work with them. Turning an enemy into a friend was also a way of eliminating an enemy.\n\nFrom Fang Yuan’s perspective, killing was just a method.\n\nOther than killing, there were many other methods he could use.\n\nTo achieve his goals, he had to use the most appropriate and effective method, regardless of what it entailed.\n\nThis was different from Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable handled matters and conflict with basically one method.\n\nThat was to kill!\n\nYou do not relent? Kill!\n\nYou are an eyesore? Kill!\n\nHis own mood was bad? Kill!\n\nHe was bored? Kill!\n\nFang Yuan began to inspect heavenly dew oasis.\n\nHe had already seen the acupuncture trees, they were at the periphery. But he had to enter the formation to observe the lake water within it.\n\nHeavenly dew oasis not only had a lot of water resources, they were of various types.\n\nCommonly seen were delicate springs, jade toad drool, bitter fragrance water, more rare ones included divine strength water, black-white water, and others.\n\nThere was a huge quantity of Gu materials, with immortal materials of all kinds.\n\nFor example, even though divine strength water was a type of water, it contained strength path dao marks, it was a rank six strength path immortal material in the market.\n\nIn mortal fables, divine strength water had a lot of names, often, when mortal heroes drink this water, they would gain divine strength and be able to defeat evil Gu Masters.\n\nAnd because this divine strength water was an immortal material, drinking it without food path methods would kill even a Gu Immortal just because of its strength path dao marks!\n\nTherefore, the mortals of these stories often die themselves after taking revenge.\n\nThe most important one was black-white water.\n\nBlack-white water was a rank seven immortal material, it was situated at the center of heavenly dew oasis.\n\nDuring daytime, the black-white water would be white, during night, it would be black.\n\nPlacing the black-white water there while exposed to the sky, as the days and nights cycle, the black-white water would create drops of heavenly dew.\n\nThe heavenly dew was transparent and looked like a droplet, it was round and each drop had the size of a baby’s finger.\n\nThe heavenly dew could not fuse together, droplets could only be placed together but not as one entity.\n\nThe most valuable thing in heavenly dew oasis was the heavenly dew.\n\nIt was a rank eight immortal material!\n\nFang Yuan soon found that this black-white water region had a hundred droplets of heavenly dew accumulated here.\n\nYing Wu Xie attacked this place but did not reach the center, the heavenly dew that had accumulated for half a year was still here.\n\nFang Yuan smiled as he stored thirty droplets of heavenly dew away without hesitation.\n\nThis was the hidden rule of the righteous path.\n\nAny Gu Immortal sent to defend the resource points would secretly keep a portion of the resources for their own cultivation needs.\n\nOf course, this was not an outright rule.\n\nBut basically, all the super forces allowed this.\n\nBeing stationed outside to defend resource points was a tough job, it had risks. Without this benefit, who would want to do it?\n\nIn the five hundred years of his previous life, Fang Yuan had learned about these things. Taking thirty drops of heavenly dew was the limit already, this was a valuable sum, it was three months of heavenly dew oasis’ accumulation! If he took more, Fang clan would not be happy, they would accuse him of embezzlement.\n\n“It is a pity that the nine heavens shattered, only black heaven and white heaven are left.”\n\n“If the nine heavens were around, according to this heavenly dew oasis’ location, this would not be black-white water but rank eight immortal material nine colored water. Nine colored water faces the sky and experiences the nine different heavens continuously, with the direct rays of the stars, moon, and sun from the nine heavens, it would produce a drop of nine heavenly star sweat every year from this nine colored water.”\n\nNine heavenly star sweat was a rank nine immortal material, it was one of the three waters of heaven and earth, along with myriad being creation water and rising falling tide water. It had extreme value, it was rare even among rank nine immortal materials.\n\nDifferent from the three fires of heaven and earth, the nine heavenly star sweat of the three waters of heaven and earth had already vanished.\n\nBecause seven of the nine heavens were already gone, only two heavens were left.\n\nAfter looking at all the resources, Fang Yuan sighed in admiration, this heavenly dew oasis was truly one of Western Desert’s top ten oases, he looked at the formation again.\n\nHe was tasked to guard this place, he obviously could use the formation.\n\nFang clan gave him the methods to utilize this formation, Fang Yuan tried activating them and comprehending the workings of this formation.\n\nHe had formation path grandmaster attainment level, he also had wisdom path methods, he quickly gained some knowledge.\n\nCompared to Chi clan, Fang clan’s defensive formation at heavenly dew oasis was not impressive. Thus, Fang clan spent a lot of effort to place the acupuncture trees here as a form of defense.\n\nFang clan was like Chi clan, they excelled in formation path.\n\nBut the difference was, Fang clan excelled in Immortal Gu Houses, because Immortal Gu Houses were a type of mobile immortal formation.\n\nMeanwhile, Chi clan excelled in creating immobile formations, that was the mainstream of formation path.\n\nAnd most importantly, Chi clan had a formation path great grandmaster, Chi Qu You!\n\nFormation path Gu Immortals who had great grandmaster attainment level could use natural dao marks to set up immortal formations. Not only could they save on Immortal Gu, they could even use the environment to create strong defenses while helping the development of the resource point, increasing its yield.\n\nFang clan set up this formation in heavenly dew oasis, they used many Immortal Gu. But the formation’s main purpose was to increase the heavenly dew production, it was not focused on defense.\n\n“But Fang clan’s specialty is very strong too.”\n\n“They own multiple Immortal Gu Houses, not only do they have high mobility, they can use the Immortal Gu Houses to fight rank eight enemies with just rank six Gu Immortals.”\n\n“If I am Fang clan’s leader, in this situation, I would gather my people to attack one enemy, by displaying a fierce demeanor, we can intimidate and deter the rest of the Western Desert righteous path forces.”\n\n“But they would need to pay close attention to the extent of their actions, if they go overboard, they would be in trouble. If they do too little, it would deter no one.”\n\nFang Yuan was thinking about Fang clan and Western Desert’s righteous path forces now.\n\nHe had to cultivate during this period of time, processing his gains and modifying killer moves, it did not matter if he was in Western Desert or Southern Border.\n\nTime was quite pressing.\n\nVery soon, Southern Border’s righteous path would come to agreement, they would come after him.\n\nFlipping heaven sand sea.\n\nHuge sand waves were rising and falling continuously. Under the rays of the moonlight, white sand looked like snow, sand waves rose to tens of feet with a grand aura, it was a famous sight in Western Desert.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals had secretly gathered, approaching treasure moon oasis within the sand sea.\n\n“According to the intel, Dong clan’s Dong Lu Chen has already arrived. Let’s go!’ Fang Di Chang transmitted secretly.\n\n“Good!” Fang Gong burst out with overwhelming aura, attacking treasure moon oasis directly.\n\nDong Lu Chen flew up, his rank eight aura also permeated the area, he shouted with shock and anger: “Fang Gong, I did not approach you for trouble, but you are actually attacking me!”\n\nFang Gong roared: “Cut the crap, let’s fight.”\n\nThe battle of two rank eight Gu Immortals caused thunderous sounds and intense explosions.\n\nDong Lu Chen was in a passive spot, he was quite restricted as he had to defend the treasure moon oasis behind him.\n\nHe blocked Fang Gong’s attacks as his expression sank: “Fang clan, just you wait! You dare to attack the territory of righteous path forces, you have broken the rules, in just a while, the whole of Western Desert’s super forces will inflict judgment upon you!”\n\n“Is that so? Didn’t your Dong clan spread the rumor that treasure moon oasis was once attacked by our clan? Since you do not have evidence, we are so kind as to come here and give you some evidence.” A strangely shaped broken Immortal Gu House flew into the sky, Fang Di Chang’s voice came from within it.\n\nDong Lu Chen became even more furious: “Fang Di Chang, you are a mere rank seven, you dare…”\n\nBefore he finished, Fang clan’s Immortal Gu House unleashed an immortal killer move.\n\nDong Lu Chen’s anger vanished all of a sudden, replaced by deep shock and fear.\n\n“This immortal killer move, don’t tell me?!”\n\n“Exactly, it is the killer move that Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable used to create his path — Steal Dao!” Fang Di Chang answered.\n\n“No!” Dong Lu Chen growled, he turned to look at treasure moon oasis.\n\nDue to the killer move steal dao, the countless natural dao marks of treasure moon oasis became exposed, they were either long or short, most were lines that weaved together, forming some sort of mysterious shape. Some were like webs while others were like balls of thread, accumulating into a mountain.\n\nDong Lu Chen tried to stop them but it was futile.\n\nHe watched with a furious expression as these dao marks were all drawn into that theft path Immortal Gu House that Fang clan owned.\n\nThis was the power of the killer move steal dao!\n\nBy activating this move, one could directly steal dao marks.\n\nIn the past, after creating this move, Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable gathered enough foundation to trigger a qualitative change, officially establishing the new Gu path, theft path."
