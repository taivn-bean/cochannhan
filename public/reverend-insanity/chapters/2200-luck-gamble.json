But Star Constellation Immortal Venerable needed to suppress Limitless’ chains and control them, she was basically protecting Fang Yuan.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable heaved a deep sigh.\n\nEven if she was the number one person in the wisdom path, she had more problems than she could cope with.\n\nFrom her point of view: Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was the strongest enemy in her life, she had to pay enough attention to him. Comparatively, Fang Yuan’s threat was lower, but he could not be ignored. After all, many venerables had invested in him, even Star Costellation’s will had invested in him when Spectral Soul refined sovereign immortal fetus Gu.\n\nFang Yuan could not be left alone, if he was allowed to act as he pleased, he would give her huge problems!\n\nHaving this understanding, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable suddenly took out Book Mountain.\n\nA chess piece flew out, it was Zhou Xiong Xin!\n\nZhou Xiong Xin landed on the middle of the mountain and controlled it with all his strength.\n\nBook Mountain let out golden light, they were actually Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s luck path killer moves.\n\nThese luck path killer moves attacked Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, stopping him temporarily.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable attacked Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan did not activate Dang Hun Luo Po Seal.\n\nThis method was amplified by his countless dao marks, it was far stronger than Hu elevation. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable could disregard the cost to retrieve Star Constellation Chessboard Formation and release Limitless’ chains.\n\nAdding on the previous accumulated ‘hatred’ towards five restriction profound light qi, Fang Yuan would be fiercely shackled by Limitless’ chains, his situation would be even worse than Qi Sea Ancestor’s.\n\nAt that time, Fang Yuan would lose his battle strength, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable could take out Star Constellation Chessboard again and make the situation greatly advantageous for Heavenly Court.\n\nNaturally, in the process of Star Constellation Chessboard being stored and taken out, it would be damaged, and even Star Constellation Immortal Venerable would suffer damage.\n\nBut how great would this damage be?\n\nAccording to Fang Yuan’s estimation, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable could endure it.\n\nSo, Fang Yuan did not attack, instead he retreated into the five restriction profound light qi.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable smiled.\n\nFang Yuan’s action was within her expectations.\n\nInformation about Dang Hun Luo Po Seal had already been transmitted from the Door of Life and Death. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was slightly disappointed that Fang Yuan did not use this method.\n\nBut, Fang Yuan retreating into the five restriction profound light qi made it convenient for Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to take her next action.\n\nAt the next moment, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable gave a cry. Hundreds of vertical and horizontal starry paths twisted and turned like water waves, they quickly gathered and weaved an azure sphere, covering all the five restriction profound light qi and Fang Yuan inside.\n\nFang Yuan was actually sealed.\n\nFive restriction profound light qi was still continuing to spread, but the space inside the azure sphere was vast. It would take a long time to fill it completely.\n\n“An excellent response.” Fang Yuan praised.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable used wisdom path and star path to imitate space path. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not break five restriction profound light qi, but found a way to restrain it.\n\nThis response was amazing, not only did she use Star Constellation Chessboard Formation to a whole new level, there were extraordinary methods like dao embroidery used as well.\n\nFang Yuan was trapped, but he was not hurried.\n\nHe waited for Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s performance.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun was extremely shrewd, he definitely realized Heavenly Court’s weakness and his side’s advantage.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable took the risk to deal with Fang Yuan, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun had a good chance of success over on his end. On the contrary, if Star Constellation Immortal Venerable dealt with Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, Fang Yuan could make some arrangements. Although the strength of these cheap tricks was small, they would definitely cause great annoyance to Star Constellation Immortal Venerable. If they were not resolved immediately, these cheap tricks would become the key to suppressing Heavenly Court!\n\nSure enough, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun shouted, a giant wave of golden light pushed Book Mountain aside as it charged towards Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nBook Mountain was sent flying like a meteor.\n\nZhou Xiong Xin, who was on the mountain, was already smashed to a pulp. This was the price of forcefully controlling Book Mountain!\n\nThis rank eight expert used all his strength but only stopped Immortal Zombie Giant Sun for a few breaths of time. This was the case even when he had Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s help, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun had also restrained his strength to prevent damaging Limitless’ formation.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun managed to get some free time, he immediately began preparing a method.\n\nThis chance did not come easily. When he fought with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable earlier, they attacked constantly, he had no such chances.\n\nHowever, at the next moment.\n\n“This killer move is finally complete.” Golden Hooped Great Immortal suddenly appeared, “Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, you fooled me, I invited you to Heavenly Court as a guest, but you took the chance to make your arrangements. During the fate war, Heavenly Court headquarters was ambushed by your Longevity Heaven!”\n\nThe moment he finished speaking, Golden Hooped Great Immortal used his life and all his cultivation to activate a killer move.\n\nThe mysterious light shone down and fell on Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s head, turning into a golden hoop.\n\nThe golden hoop bound Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s forehead, causing his mind and body to turn slightly sluggish.\n\nA female immortal appeared behind Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\nIt was Qin Ding Ling!\n\n“Giant Sun, I am repaying you for all the humiliation you have given me back then!!” Qin Ding Ling shouted, slamming her hands on Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s back.\n\nImmortal killer move — Luck Gamble!\n\nA black and white Gu worm resembling a die flew out of Qin Ding Ling’s phantom aperture, it rolled rapidly before coming to a stop.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun — Three!\n\nThe die Gu worm rolled once again before coming to a stop, revealing a number on its surface.\n\nQin Ding Ling — Five!\n\nBam!\n\nIn an instant, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s vast luck was transferred to Qin Ding Ling.\n\nQin Ding Ling’s body shook, her face reddened, and her teeth clattered together. She could only endure with all her strength and had no strength to fight for the moment.\n\n“Back then, when I forcibly took away a portion of Crazed Demon Cave’s Thieving Heaven true inheritance, a mysterious Immortal Gu escaped, I could not catch it in time. It seems like it was obtained by you in the end.” Immortal Zombie Giant Sun came to a realization.\n\nQin Ding Ling perspired profusely as she took in the endless luck while replying with hatred: “To deal with you, I gave up on metal path, I sealed and buried myself deep under the earth in a metal coffin, cultivating in seclusion as I comprehended luck path. During these three hundred thousand years, this gamble Gu was attracted to me and came to the metal coffin one day. From that moment, I realized this was the backlash of you forcefully taking Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance, it is also my fortuitous encounter to take revenge. Gamble, gamble, let us gamble with our lives!”\n\nThe intense golden light around Immortal Zombie Giant Sun dimmed rapidly.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun’s expression turned solemn.\n\nThe foundation of his combat system was based on powerful and prosperous luck. He had all kinds of killer moves that helped him to maintain positive and powerful luck, for instance, the unforeseen disaster killer move he used in the Door of Life and Death, to extract his bad luck to deal with the enemy. Although it reduced the size of his luck, his luck path methods quickly restored it, on the whole, his luck became even better.\n\nOnce Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s positive luck was stronger than the enemy’s, his defense, offense, healing and other aspects would also rise based on the difference, always being higher than his enemy’s.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable’s methods were extremely powerful and exquisite. Under the support of such a combat system, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was invincible.\n\nHis luck path methods had never been spread, how could other Gu Immortals seize his luck?\n\nMost Gu Immortals’ luck would fall to rock-bottom within ten or so rounds, while Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s strength would continue to rise.\n\nWhile it looked like Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was in a stalemate with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, the fact was that he had already accumulated a huge advantage in terms of luck. At the final juncture, when the Crazed Demon formation stops and the eternal life research results emerge, without Limitless’ retaliation anymore, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun could erupt with extreme strength.\n\nBut now, Qin Ding Ling dug at his foundation!\n\nQin Ding Ling had almost performed a miracle!\n\nJust based on gamble Gu, Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable’s retaliation would not be able to accomplish this.\n\nJust Qin Ding Ling alone also could not accomplish this.\n\nEven Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s arrangements and schemes alone could not dig at Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s foundation.\n\nBut these three factors joined to achieve a miracle-like achievement!\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun immediately activated a killer move, his thoughts increased and collided rapidly: “I fell for Star Constellation’s scheme.”\n\n“She had already prepared this trump card to deal with me, but just did not have a chance before.”\n\n“When Fang Yuan used five restriction profound light qi, she saw the chance.”\n\n“She intentionally left to deal with Fang Yuan, even throwing out Book Mountain, it was just to show me weakness.”\n\n“She succeeded after all!”\n\nBook Mountain was a secluded domain of heaven and earth, but in Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s eyes, it was only a chess piece that could be casually thrown.\n\nIn fact, many Heavenly Court members on Star Constellation Chessboard Formation were all Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s chess pieces.\n\nEven Fang Yuan was used by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to lure Immortal Zombie Giant Sun!\n\nJust like how Immortal Zombie Giant Sun took Heavenly Court as his enemy, Heavenly Court also considered Longevity Heaven and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun as an obstacle.\n\nFang Yuan?\n\nAlthough Fang Yuan was very strong, even destroying fate Gu, he was selected by heaven’s will and received the help of venerables. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable used Fang Yuan, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable also made arrangements for Fang Yuan…\n\nFang Yuan was a chess piece.\n\nEven if Fang Yuan’s ambition was huge, wanting to become a refinement path venerable, turning into a player from a chess piece, Primordial Domain was already destroyed, how could he become refinement path Demon Venerable?\n\nIf he could not become venerable, even if he had more dao marks, he would only be a pseudo venerable.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had already returned to being Dao Lords!\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable left Fang Yuan and returned to fight Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\n“Go.” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable pointed at Qin Ding Ling, Star Constellation Chessboard Formation activated, the chess piece Qin Ding Ling immediately disappeared on the spot and appeared at the edge of the battlefield.\n\nThe killer move luck gamble was already activated, Qin Ding Ling had completed this crucial part!\n\nLuck gamble!\n\nAfter Qin Ding Ling recovered, she activated the killer move again.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun — Three!\n\nQin Ding Ling — Two!\n\nBoom…\n\nAt this time, Qin Ding Ling’s luck surged out and transferred back to Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\nLuck gamble killer move’s power was like this, it could not be controlled by people. The numbers determined victory or defeat, but the outcome was determined randomly, even Qin Ding Ling, who was the user could not influence it."
