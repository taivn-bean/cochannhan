  "content": "1895 Mid-sized Missions Small sized missions gave one to ten merit points. Meanwhile, mid-sized missions gave eleven to a hundred merit points.\n\nFang Yuan exchanged for a ‘good person’ title, it allowed him to accept mid-sized missions.\n\nMid-sized missions were Gu Immortal level, the tiger king salamander that Fang Yuan dealt with this time was a rank six desolate beast but its battle strength had reached rank seven.\n\nThis mission’s difficulty was way beyond the limits of a mortal.\n\nThe higher the difficulty, the greater the reward.\n\n“Thus, I earned over ninety merit points this time…” Fang Yuan realized: “The reason why I did not get a hundred is because I took away the tiger king salamander’s corpse. If I left it behind, the dao marks on the corpse would spread out and elevate the foundation of the surrounding environment.”\n\nFang Yuan had done this purposely.\n\nHe was curious about the reason why the tiger king salamander went on a rampage.\n\nThus, he brought this corpse with him, planning to research on it later.\n\nIn the previous life, Miao Ming Shen and the rest encountered this situation many times, they researched together but did not find the root cause. This time, Fang Yuan wanted to try it himself.\n\nThe group of immortals looked at Fang Yuan and the merit board, their expressions and emotions were similarly terrible.\n\nThey had worked so hard to complete their missions, each one gave ten merit points at most. Fang Yuan however, got over ninety merit points from one mission.\n\nThis comparison was truly infuriating!\n\nEven though small sized missions were simple, they wasted a lot of time. Mid-sized missions was much more efficient in terms of merit points.\n\nLooking as Fang Yuan approached the Merit Obelisk, some of the Gu Immortals felt jealous, some were curious, while others felt despair.\n\nAt this rate, Fang Yuan was taking huge steps forward while they were crawling like snails, how could they ever catch up to him? He would only leave them in the dust as time passed!\n\nHua Die looked at Miao Ming Shen, wanting to ask Fang Yuan about this, but he shook his head at her.\n\nShen Cong Sheng looked over at Shen Xiao.\n\nShen Xiao had no choice, he had to force a smile and walk towards Fang Yuan.\n\n“Brother Chu.” He cupped his fists, speaking in an earnest tone and polite attitude: “Just name the price, as long as I can afford it, I will satisfy you.”\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly: “You want to know how I obtained so many merit points?”\n\n“Indeed.” Shen Xiao cupped his fists again: “I hope brother can teach us. Don’t worry, with my Shen clan’s foundation, we will not disappoint you. Furthermore, you are not just getting my friendship, you will get the friendship of Shen clan!”\n\nEarlier, Shen clan tried to force Fang Yuan but he was indifferent and acted extremely arrogantly. Shen Xiao changed his tactic and tried to exchange for it using benefits instead, it was a wise move.\n\nFang Yuan laughed: “Sure, use a true inheritance of your Shen clan to exchange for it.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s eyes shined when he heard this, he did not expect Fang Yuan to agree, he could not help but ask: “What true inheritance do you want?”\n\n“It is up to you, if you don’t want to give an inheritance, Immortal Gu are fine too.” Fang Yuan said nonchalantly.\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s lips twitched, he wanted an Immortal Gu? Dream on!\n\nHe thought about it and tossed out an information path mortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan received it and looked through the content, there was a transformation path Gu Immortal true inheritance, it was rather incomplete, the truly valuable parts were still with Shen Cong Sheng.\n\nFang Yuan clicked his tongue as he tossed the mortal Gu back to Shen Cong Sheng: “Another one.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng received the information path mortal Gu and erased the information inside, injecting a new wave of content. Of course, this was incomplete as well.\n\nFang Yuan received it and nodded, giving the information path mortal Gu back to Shen Cong Sheng: “Another one.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng received the information path mortal Gu and looked at Fang Yuan, saying grimly: “Chu Ying, you want to look at so many of them, how much content do you want to see?”\n\nFang Yuan’s expression turned solemn: “Don’t worry, I, Chu Ying, act according to my principles, I am not someone who goes back on my words. Those who treat others as fools are the real fools. How about this, give me a portion of constant wave sound and I will tell you the reason why I gained so many merit points.”\n\n“Fine, I’ll believe you once.” Shen Cong Sheng did not hesitate, taking out a conch from his immortal aperture and tossing it to Fang Yuan.\n\nThis conch was only the size of a palm, and was itself a desolate beast.\n\nThere was a wave sound stored in the conch, this wave sound was a sound path rank seven immortal material, a specialty product of Shen clan, it could produce sounds for years without ever stopping.\n\nFang Yuan inspected it and found nothing suspicious, he placed this immortal material into his sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nHe looked at Shen Cong Sheng and smiled, “Then I’ll tell you this secret. Do you want me to tell you alone, or do you wish to make it public?”\n\nThis time, it was Shen Cong Sheng’s turn to look solemn.\n\nBut he only hesitated for a moment and then smiled: “What is there to hide? Please speak directly.”\n\nAs expected of an old expert who had been leading Shen clan for many years.\n\nOnce he said that, even the Gu Immortals on Miao Ming Shen’s side developed some good feelings towards Shen Cong Sheng.\n\nMiao Ming Shen coldly snorted in his mind: “No agreement can be made here, Shen Cong Sheng can’t restrain Chu Ying at all. Chu Ying is trying to sow discord! Since he can tell Shen Cong Sheng alone, he can tell others in the future as well. Shen Cong Sheng knows this, so even if he is unwilling, he has no choice but to make it public.”\n\n“Good, Lord Shen Cong Sheng’s magnanimity is admirable.” Fang Yuan turned around and placed his palm on the surface of the obelisk.\n\nWords related to missions started to vanish before emerging again.\n\nBut these new words were different from before.\n\nThousand soul fog appeared on White Light Mountain, the living creatures were in dire need of help to clear it up.\n\nIn seahorse sea area, coral seahorses fought each other, a number of seahorse kings were rioting and needed to be suppressed.\n\nThe formation on gathering-separation island had not been repaired for years, causing serious disruptions to the lives of the islanders, it needed to be fixed.\n\nFish round island lacked seawater, one had to make it rain for three days and nights there.\n\n…\n\nThe Gu Immortals were stunned.\n\nThese missions were clearly different from the previous ones, such as the thousand soul fog, which was a soul path rank seven immortal material, it was quite famous. Another example was that every coral seahorse was a rank five wild beast, while seahorse kings were at least desolate beasts.\n\nShen Xiao watched with glimmering eyes as he sighed deeply: “These are missions worthy of Gu Immortals.”\n\nThose small sized missions earlier were limited to the mortal level, they were simply weak in comparison to these missions.\n\nShen Xiao copied Fang Yuan and placed his hand on the obelisk but his expression turned to confusion: “Why can’t I accept these missions?”\n\n“Of course not. I have used up a hundred merit points in order to accept these missions.” Fang Yuan smiled.\n\nThe immortals quickly focused their attention on his words.\n\nBut Fang Yuan kept his mouth shut.\n\nShen Xiao became anxious, he cupped his fists at Fang Yuan: “Please do teach us, Brother Chu.”\n\nFang Yuan looked at him with a slightly mocking expression with raised brows: “Why should I tell you?”\n\nShen Xiao’s expression froze: “We made a deal earlier.”\n\n“I know. You guys asked how I acquired a large amount of merit points. I have completed the transaction and told you the reason, it was because I received these missions. As for how to receive these missions, that is a different question.” Fang Yuan said.\n\nThe group of immortals were dumbfounded.\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s expression turned dark while the Shen clan Gu Immortals looked at Fang Yuan with anger in their eyes.\n\nShen Xiao was stunned before he laughed again, only this time, it was clearly mixed with anger: “Brother Chu is really impressive at doing business. A single answer alone earned you a rank seven immortal material that is unique to my clan.”\n\nFang Yuan nodded: “Shen clan’s constant wave sound is unique in the world, I really profited from this transaction. But I did not lie to you, I did not give you false information either. I, Chu Ying, am not such a person.”\n\nFang Yuan showed a demeanor of having a conscience and bottom-line, it made all of the immortals here seethe with anger.\n\nShen Cong Sheng’s anger accumulated.\n\nHe was a grand righteous path rank eight, he was actually being toyed by this rank seven lone immortal Chu Ying who had no fame, how could he let this pass?\n\n“After we leave Dragon Whale Paradise, I am going to deal with you properly!” Shen Cong Sheng swore in his heart, but he smiled and laughed heartily without showing any displeasure, he clapped: “Chu Ying, very impressive. You obtained the constant wave sound through your wittiness, that was your ability. Don’t worry, why would my Shen clan be so petty over a small matter? Come, let’s make another deal, tell me what you want in exchange for this information to get the mission?”\n\nThe group of immortals looked at Fang Yuan with eyes that could not help but reveal envy.\n\nIt was just so easy to earn immortal materials like this.\n\nBut from Shen Cong Sheng’s perspective, his clan was affluent, one or two rank seven immortal materials in exchange for precious information was not a bad deal.\n\nBut Fang Yuan shook his head: “I am not going to sell this information, you all can try it yourselves.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng glared: “Chu Ying, I hope that you will think about it clearly!”\n\nFang Yuan, however, ignored him and disappeared again with a flash of white light.\n\nShen Cong Sheng was livid, he was not given any face at all.\n\n“Chu Ying, don’t let me catch you outside!” Shen Cong Sheng swore in his heart. This was the first time he had seen such a rank seven Gu Immortal, he completely disregarded him.\n\nFang Yuan needed to maintain his advantage on the merit board, this was useful to his plan of conquering the paradise.\n\n“As for Shen Cong Sheng and the rest… hehe, I don’t believe that you can stay united.” Fang Yuan smiled coldly in his heart, his plan to sow discord did not work earlier because it was a minor action, but this time, he dug a pit, he was not afraid that Shen Cong Sheng would not jump in.\n\nIn a way, Fang Yuan needed external help. It was necessary to split up this huge group.\n\nHe could complete the mid-sized missions independently by himself, but after the mid-sized missions, there were large sized missions too.\n\nThis kind of mission often required different Gu Immortals to cooperate with each other and work together to complete it.\n\nAlthough Fang Yuan had quite a few Gu Immortal subordinates hidden in his immortal aperture, it was useless. In this Dragon Whale Paradise, Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s methods restricted this.\n\nIt seemed that only those Gu Immortals who had passed that test outside and were sent to the starting island while asleep were eligible to enter and leave this place, and also receiving and completing missions.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan left, the atmosphere at the Merit Obelisk turned heavy.\n\nBecause Shen Cong Sheng had made a rather forceful request, he wanted the surrounding Gu Immortals to spend their respective merit points to exchange for those contentious rewards.\n\nShen Cong Sheng was betting that one of these rewards would be the one Fang Yuan exchanged for earlier!\n\nSince Fang Yuan did not tell him, he was going to test it personally.\n\nMiao Ming Shen and the rest were unwilling to do that but they had no choice, they had to make considerations for the future and could not offend this rank eight sound path great expert."
