Her strong hair roots had degraded and become loose.\n\nYu Yi Ye Zi spoke with a heavy voice: “It is probably love Gu. Love Gu consumed your lifespan to burst out with the terrifying power that could directly kill Zhao Pu!”\n\n“Is that so?” Zhao Lian Yun was dazed and at a loss.\n\nAnyone who turned from the prime of their youth to an old and frail person the next moment, would definitely receive a huge shock in their mind.\n\n“Yes.” Yu Yi Ye Zi nodded, and consoled, “But you don’t have to worry, you can restore your youth by using lifespan Gu. Normal Gu Immortals might not be able to gather lifespan Gu, but you are different, you are the current generation fairy of Spirit Affinity House, the sect will definitely provide you lifespan Gu.”\n\nZhao Lian Yun did not reply.\n\nShe was feeling complicated emotions. Shock, disappointment, disbelief, dazedness.\n\nShe was an otherworldly demon, but even before transmigrating, she had not experienced becoming this old.\n\nAfter a while of silence, Zhao Lian Yun finally recovered from the shock.\n\n“I will continue going forward!”\n\n“Old age doesn’t matter, Hong Yun is still waiting for me.”\n\nZhao Lian Yun gazed at the distant first snowy peak through the window, her gaze becoming resolute once more.\n\n“You cannot continue!!” Yu Yi Ye Zi was shocked, quickly walking over to Zhao Lian Yun and holding her arm.\n\n“Love Immortal Gu is powerful but it is not stable. Maybe it will take your lifespan the next time as well. If so, you will definitely die!” Yu Yi Ye Zi persuaded.\n\n“So what if I die?” The old Zhao Lian Yun looked at the young Yu Yi Ye Zi with a slight smile.\n\nHer smile was not even a little beautiful, but Yu Yi Ye Zi was dazed.\n\nThen, Zhao Lian Yun softly drew back her arm.\n\nShe clearly did not use much strength, but Yu Yi Ye Zi felt a formless strength attacking his heart, letting him voluntarily release his hand.\n\nHe then quietly stood on the spot, looking at Zhao Lian Yun’s hunched back, looking at her walking towards the outside of the hall with heavy and aged steps.\n\nThis scene was ordinary and nothing strange, but Yu Yi Ye Zi felt an intense tremor in his heart.\n\nHe even subconsciously held his breath, as Zhao Lian Yun’s weak receding figure imprinted deeply in him at this moment.\n\n“What kind of spirit is this!”\n\n“For her love, she is willing to make sacrifices, unafraid of death and destruction.”\n\n“Zhao Lian Yun, I would have definitely died in Zhao Pu’s hands without you.”\n\n“Alright, let me follow you, at worst, this life will be paid to you!”\n\nYu Yi Ye Zi was not old, he was still hot-blooded, and after firming up his mind, he quickly followed Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nThere was not much immortal essence left in her phantom aperture, Zhao Lian Yun was also worried that recklessly summoning love Immortal Gu would spend what little remained of her lifespan. As such, she chose to walk down the peak.\n\nUnder the effect of the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation, Zhao Lian Yun and Yu Yi Ye Zi separated, and she alone went to another snowy peak.\n\nThere was still a large hall at the peak, and the atmosphere was quiet.\n\n“There was a battle here!” Zhao Lian Yun slowly walked to the hall, finding the inside of the hall in ruins, signs of an intense battle were everywhere.\n\n“Fairy Lian Yun?” A voice suddenly transmitted to Zhao Lian Yun’s ears.\n\nZhao Lian Yun was slightly dazed, before shortly recognizing the voice as that water path Gu Immortal, Mu Ling Lan’s voice.\n\n“This is the eighth peak of Snowy Mountain blessed land, I fought with the owner of this peak, Xiao Fei Fei, and now, we are both wounded.”\n\n“We are both hiding right now, healing our injuries as quickly as possible.”\n\n“You need to be careful, don’t be hit by her ability. She has an immortal killer move which can cause the target to continuously lose their memories.”\n\nJust as he finished speaking, a ray of strange light flew and struck Zhao Lian Yun’s forehead.\n\n“No!” Mu Ling Lan quickly called out, “Every time you lose your memory, the related memory will float in your mind. Use Immortal Gu to defend yourself, don’t use any immortal killer moves, that would be even more dangerous. If you forget an immortal killer move by any chance, you will suffer the backlash from the immortal killer move. Persevere, wait until I heal my injuries and recover some strength to fight!”\n\nZhao Lian Yun quickly agreed.\n\nShe hid in a corner and used Immortal Gu to protect herself, then waited for the killer move to activate.\n\n“Damn it!” Zhao Lian Yun gradually felt unease. She knew her situation, she had just recently become a Gu Immortal, most of her battles came from during her training time. It would be an extremely huge blow to her if the memories of this period were erased.\n\nMemories began to surface in her mind…\n\nNorthern Plains.\n\nMa tribe was defeated, and surrendered to Hei tribe.\n\n“I didn’t think we could still live, Lady Xiao Yun!” Ma Hong Yun held Zhao Lian Yun’s hands and spun round and round on the spot, “Hahaha.”\n\n“Let me down, you big fool!” Zhao Lian Yun shouted.\n\n…\n\nImperial Court blessed land.\n\n“You, kid, are truly lucky, you actually became Chang tribe’s son-in-law, hahaha.” Zhao Lian Yun patted Ma Hong Yun’s shoulder.\n\nMa Hong Yun chuckled while scratching his hair: “Lady Xiao Yun, don’t worry, you have helped me so much, I will treat you well.”\n\nZhao Lian Yun gave a sound of acknowledgement and nodded: “Then I will rely on you.”\n\nInside, however, she felt strange: Why do I have some feelings of loss and bitterness?\n\n…\n\nInside Eighty-Eight True Yang Building.\n\n“To think that you are an otherworldly demon! You are actually lurking by Ma Hong Yun’s side! Hehehe, you have such guts, you are really daring. Unfortunately… you met me.” Giant Sun’s will exuded strong killing intent.\n\nZhao Lian Yun felt like she had fallen in an ice cave, shouting in her mind: “Damn it, there is still such an obstacle? Transmigrators are otherworldly demons? This world is too big of a trap! Oh no, my death is certain this time!! I am actually going to die here?”\n\nBut the next moment, Ma Hong Yun stood in front of Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nHe spread open his arms, protecting Zhao Lian Yun behind him.\n\n“Boy, you want to protect an otherworldly demon?” Giant Sun’s will sharpened his tone, his expression becoming ice-cold.\n\n“What otherworldly demon! I don’t know any otherworldly demon, I only know she is Lady Xiao Yun, without her help, I would likely have been killed already.” Ma Hong Yun tried his best to defend Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nZhao Lian Yun’s pupils shrunk as she looked at Ma Hong Yun in a daze.\n\n“Even against Giant Sun’s will, this fellow will still stand up for me?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“I am clearly an otherworldly demon, and not a person of this world!”\n\n“You idiot, you are going to die. By protecting me, you are offending Giant Sun’s will, that is your ancestor, you idiot!”\n\nHei Lou Lan’s gaze towards Zhao Lian Yun started showing killing intent.\n\n“No, Lady Xiao Yun is innocent, you must not harm her!” Ma Hong Yun was extremely determined, he wholeheartedly wanted to protect Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nHowever, Giant Sun’s special will did not care about Ma Hong Yun, directly making a move against Zhao Lian Yun.\n\n“No——!” Ma Hong Yun saw the situation going south, he called out in a moment of desperation, extending both his arms and hugging Zhao Lian Yun within his bosom.\n\nDuring this moment.\n\nTime seemed to have become endlessly slow.\n\nZhao Lian Yun was curled up in Ma Hong Yun’s chest, her heart beginning to beat wildly.\n\nAn unprecedented feeling of safety and warmth filled her heart.\n\nFollowing that came a kind of panic.\n\nThis panic was not towards her life hanging by a thread, instead it was a strange feeling that came from the depths of her heart.\n\nZhao Lian Yun found at this moment that she had hopelessly fallen in love with the stupid Ma Hong Yun.\n\nIn this world, there could be guys who would watch the stars with her, accompany her to shout at the valley, heal her and give her flowers. But who would sacrifice their life for her?!\n\nIn this world, otherworldly demons were despised by even Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, who would be so stupid to protect her?\n\nMa Hong Yun.\n\nMa Hong Yun!\n\n…\n\nThe memories surfaced one by one in Zhao Lian Yun’s mind.\n\nThen, they started to disappear one by one.\n\n“No, stop it!” Tears filled Zhao Lian Yun’s face as she called out with incomparable sorrow.\n\nXiao Fei Fei’s voice transmitted: “Hehehe, when you are struck by my immortal killer move, you will lose your most precious memories. Do you feel pain? It doesn’t matter, the more you forget, the more relaxed you will be, maybe you will even smile. Hehehe….”\n\nThe memories disappeared, a smile suddenly appeared on Zhao Lian Yun’s face.\n\n“Don’t smile. This is Xiao Fei Fei’s famous sinister killer move, it will kill people while they smile. The longer you smile, the more easily you will lose your life.” Mu Ling Lan quickly transmitted his voice to warn her.\n\nHowever, Zhao Lian Yun seemed to have turned silly, as her smile became increasingly wider.\n\n“Damn it!” Mu Ling Lan knew he had to take action.\n\nHe unleashed his killer move after a long period of preparation, creating an incredible effect!\n\n“Ahh! You actually…” Xiao Fei Fei had exposed her location while attacking Zhao Lian Yun, and was struck by the fatal move while unprepared, losing her life miserably.\n\n“Fairy Lian Yun, you need to persevere!” Mu Ling Lan quickly rushed over and helped Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nZhao Lian Yun still had a smile on her face, but she was no longer in a daze.\n\nTwo streams of translucent tears dripped down her face from her eyes.\n\nHer eyes were blurry from age and her hair had turned white, she could only use Gu worms to transmit her voice.\n\n“What should I do?”\n\n“I have forgotten almost everything about him, even his appearance.”\n\n“I only remember his name.”\n\n“I only remember….”\n\n“That I love him.”"
