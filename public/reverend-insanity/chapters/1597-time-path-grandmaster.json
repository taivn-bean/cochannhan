  "content": "Chapter 1597: Time Path Grandmaster\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nTime path dream realm.\n\nFang Yuan turned into a young looking rank six Gu Immortal, his eyes were shut as his body was covered in specks of white light.\n\nAs the number of white lights increased, Fang Yuan’s aura became denser and more stable.\n\nSuddenly, his body shook, his aura became chaotic, it was like a tall building collapsing into the abyss.\n\nGuh.\n\nFang Yuan opened his mouth, spitting out a mouthful of blood.\n\n“I failed again.” He opened his eyes, bright light shining within.\n\nHe had already failed to activate shrink time three times, this was a rank six killer move used to supplement time cutting edge.\n\nWith three consecutive failures, Fang Yuan’s soul foundation fell with each injury, his thirty million man soul had fallen to twenty-nine million six hundred thousand.\n\nThis was not Thieving Heaven’s dream realm after all, the soul foundation loss in Thieving Heaven’s dream realm was too absurd.\n\nFang Yuan did not feel discouraged, his gaze flickered as fighting spirit rose in him.\n\nIgnoring the rest, just shrink time itself was very valuable. It was not only useful for time cutting edge, he could supplement it for other time path killer moves.\n\nThe exploration failed, Fang Yuan’s soul left the dream realm, returning to heal in the sovereign immortal body.\n\nGuts Gu.\n\nFang Yuan took out a guts Gu and used it.\n\nEarlier, he had an abundant supply, but now, he had to use them wisely.\n\nHe did not have many guts Gu, Fang Yuan planned to use them for the healing of his soul. Therefore, he could only stop his soul path cultivation.\n\nThe truth was, not only would Fang Yuan’s soul foundation remain stagnant, as he explored more dream realms later, it would continue to fall. This was something to be expected, there was no helping it.\n\nSoul path cultivation was no longer his priority, he needed to head into the River of Time and obtain Red Lotus’ true inheritance, that was the most logical plan!\n\nFang Yuan needed to go soon.\n\nFirstly, the longer he waited, the more problems that would arise. His enemy was Heavenly Court which had a deep foundation, they might have another great expert awakening at any time. Heavenly Court also had traps set in the River of Time, the more time passed, the more traps there would be.\n\nSecondly, Fang Yuan was placing his hope on Red Lotus’ true inheritance to resist Heavenly Court and preventing fate Immortal Gu from being repaired. This had the greatest chance of success now. But in the worst case scenario that Red Lotus’ true inheritance could not help him, he had to make other plans. Thus, the earlier Fang Yuan obtained Red Lotus’ true inheritance, the more time he had to deal with the future.\n\nAs for his soul path cultivation becoming stagnant or falling, or even the lack of immortal essence, Fang Yuan did not care. Of course, he was not ignoring them, he already had the way to settle them. Once Dang Hun Mountain was repaired, everything would be in order again!\n\nOther than this method, Fang Yuan had no way of resolving these problems now.\n\nCurrently, Dang Hun Mountain was about thirty to forty percent restored, but the soul path dao marks had not reached a qualitative change yet, it could not produce guts Gu.\n\nAfter resting his soul, Fang Yuan entered the dream realm again.\n\nThis time, he finally succeeded in activating shrink time.\n\nThe first three failures were not for nothing, each failure led Fang Yuan closer to success.\n\nFang Yuan finally grasped the killer move shrink time.\n\nOf course, the shrink time obtained in the dream realm might not be usable in the real world. After all, dreams and reality were different.\n\nFang Yuan was clear in his mind, the content of shrink time was accurate. Even if there were differences, with the light of wisdom, he could spend some time to create a version usable in real life.\n\nAt this point, this stage of the dream realm has been cleared, the entire cultivation area faded from Fang Yuan’s view.\n\nHis time path attainment started to rise rapidly before stopping.\n\n“I am still a time path master. But… compared to before, it has risen a bit, I am approaching grandmaster.”\n\nIn the second stage of the dream realm, Fang Yuan started to practise time cutting edge.\n\nThis move was even more difficult and complex than myriad self back then.\n\nFang Yuan focused his mind and practised, he soon felt his head spinning, thoughts were expended rapidly in his mind, it was like a dried pond.\n\nFang Yuan was very patient, he practised the contents continuously over and over again, moving towards the path of success.\n\nWhile practising, he got injured again.\n\nAfter leaving the dream realm and going back to his body, Fang Yuan was shocked to find out that not only did his soul foundation fall from this injury, his lifespan was also shaved off to some extent!\n\n“Getting injured in this dream realm will expend lifespan!” Fang Yuan’s heart jumped, this was a new discovery. But thankfully, he had a lot of lifespan Gu now, there was no issue. Of course, other Gu Immortals would think differently.\n\nJust like this, after a while, Fang Yuan got injured four times before he finally managed to use time cutting edge in the dream realm.\n\nJust once was enough, this was not reality after all, the dream realm collapsed as Fang Yuan entered the third stage.\n\nThe old man appeared again: “After six years, you finally learned time cutting edge, not bad. But we will have to test it in battle first.”\n\nFang Yuan cupped his fists: “Please arrange it.”\n\nThe old man laughed: “Rank seven Gu Immortal Li Xin is that person’s right hand man, there is chaos in the south due to ancient desolate beasts, he is there to suppress them, go kill him!”\n\nFang Yuan frowned slightly, he only had rank six cultivation level under this identity, without deep foundations, how could he kill a rank seven?\n\nThe only advantage was his killer move time cutting edge!\n\nBefore Fang Yuan could think anymore, the dream changed, the surroundings were covered in flames. A person stood in the sea of fire, looking at Fang Yuan with his triangular eyes: “So you are a lingering member of Bo clan, hmph, die!”\n\nSaying so, dark red flames surged towards Fang Yuan like a huge wave.\n\nFang Yuan quickly retreated, at the crucial moment, he activated the time path Immortal Gu in his immortal aperture.\n\nAt the next moment, the flames engulfed him.\n\nFang Yuan died in battle.\n\nThe dream realm exploration failed, Fang Yuan moved his injured soul back into his body.\n\nThis dream realm was quite ridiculous. The battle started immediately, Fang Yuan had no time to react.\n\n“Furthermore, other than time cutting edge, I can only use the other time path Immortal Gu without formulating any killer moves.”\n\nFang Yuan was quite vexed.\n\nThese time path Immortal Gu were all rank six, when used alone, how could they match the rank seven Gu Immortal Li Xin? And his dark red flame killer move was clearly rank seven!\n\n“It seems that I can only counter offense with offense and use time cutting edge against him.” Fang Yuan made up his mind after a moment.\n\nIf this was real life, Fang Yuan would fight cautiously. But the dream realm was a different case.\n\nAfter a while, Fang Yuan entered the dream realm.\n\nDark red flames came at him, but Fang Yuan did not dodge, he used immortal killer move time cutting edge.\n\nA thin blade formed instantly.\n\nThe flying blade shot out with the flash of a sharp light.\n\n“Hmm! What is this killer move…” Li Xin had a shocked expression as he fell, the dark red flames surged and burned him to a crisp.\n\nFang Yuan was deeply shocked.\n\n“This move is amazing! It could easily kill a rank seven, even though this Li Xin was covered in defensive methods. Even in the dream realm it is so powerful… it seems it is not weak in real life either!”\n\nWith Li Xin’s death, the dream realm dissipated.\n\nThe third stage of the dream was passed, Fang Yuan became a time path grandmaster!"
