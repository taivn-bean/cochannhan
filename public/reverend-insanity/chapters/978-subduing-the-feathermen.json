His intelligence is inferior just by a bit, if I were to enslave a human Gu Immortal, I might have failed.”\n\n“I had cultivated soul path previously and have some foundation in regards to my soul. But this is only at the limits of mortal levels, and my foundation in it as a Gu Immortal is quite shallow. By enslaving Zhou Zhong, my soul has become heavily burdened, if my soul was like an energetic youth before, now I have turned into an old man with a heavy load on my back. With such a sharp reduction in strength, it would be good if I can display twenty percent of my ability.”\n\nFang Yuan sighed inwardly.\n\nAll the paths of Gu were broad and profound.\n\nSo too was enslavement path.\n\nAt Gu Immortal level, there were extraordinary abilities that laymen could not grasp.\n\nSimply put, Fang Yuan was a layman in enslavement path.\n\nHe did not know of any enslavement path immortal killer moves, if he had, then in combination with slavery Immortal Gu, his current situation might have been much better.\n\nHe was only able to use the slavery Immortal Gu superficially.\n\nBut with his previous lives’ experiences, along with the help of the light of wisdom to deduce the plans, he was able to achieve a huge success.\n\n“Master, I have received control over Sacred Feather City. Zheng Ling has already moved towards the battle to support the first supreme elder.” Zhou Zhong’s voice suddenly resounded in Fang Yuan’s ears.\n\nFang Yuan excitedly licked his lips, clenching his fists subconsciously.\n\nHe send a command: “First, kill the real Yu Fei.”\n\nHe now had Yu Fei’s appearance, the real Yu Fei was his greatest flaw.\n\nShortly afterwards, Zhou Zhong’s voice arrived again: “Yu Fei is dead, turned into ashes.”\n\nAt present, Zhou Zhong was the only one controlling Sacred Feather City alone, as such, this was accomplished easily.\n\n“Good, do all you can to control the Immortal Gu House and get away from the battle!” Fang Yuan sent another command.\n\nThis time, it took a good while before Zhou Zhong’s weak voice arrived: “Forgive me, master, I was not able to do it. The whole Immortal Gu House is already locked in place by the enemies.”\n\nFang Yuan snorted, a ferocious light flashing in his eyes.\n\n“So it is still like this.” He did not feel much disappointment.\n\nIn his previous life, he had laid a trap which caused all the feathermen to suicide, and he was only able to obtain featherman Gu Immortal Zheng Ling’s soul.\n\nZheng Ling had personally participated in the battle to defend Sacred Feather City, and not much time had passed, thus his memories were extremely clear.\n\nHis soul was not like Xue Song Zi’s, which had been tampered with by a soul path expert, Fang Yuan could easily search his soul and obtain all his memories.\n\nIt was these memories that let Fang Yuan feel like he had personally experienced the battle to defend Sacred Feather City.\n\nThus, his timing was so precise, he could infiltrate the Immortal Gu House and take the opportunity when the two sides were in an intense battle to successfully enslave Gu Immortal Zhou Zhong.\n\nThere were a lot of opportunities like this, but the best one was this.\n\nZhou Zhong just happened to be restricted by an immortal killer move and was not able to budge, providing huge convenience to Fang Yuan.\n\nFrom Zheng Ling’s soul, Fang Yuan also knew this Immortal Gu House, Sacred Feather City, was locked down by the enemies and was unable to be moved.\n\nHowever, a person like Fang Yuan would absolutely not be reconciled to this, they would personally attempt it.\n\nThe attempt indeed failed and he was unable to steal this Sacred Feather City. Fang Yuan could only choose the second best option, observing from the sidelines and letting the events continue to develop.\n\nSimilarly to his previous life, Zhou Zhong carried his heavily injured body and controlled the Immortal Gu House with difficulty, freeing Zheng Ling from the duty.\n\nZheng Ling hurried to reinforce the first supreme elder and had a huge fight with White Sea Shatuo and the rest.\n\nThis huge fight was the most crucial fight of the battle to defend Sacred Feather City.\n\nThe outcome of the fight was the same as Fang Yuan’s previous life.\n\nWhite Sea Shatuo and the rest were beaten back, and escaped through the gap in the wall. The first supreme elder was heavily injured and was on the verge of death after being targeted by the combined strength of the Western Desert Gu Immortals. As for Zheng Ling, his situation was slightly better.\n\nThe battle ended, the Immortal Gu House was restored and there was no gaps anymore, its defense becoming perfect.\n\nHowever, the featherman first supreme elder’s injuries could not be healed and he died within the city.\n\nAfter losing their greatest battle strength, the two featherman Gu Immortals held on for a night, and seeing that nothing could be done, they resolutely decided to give up on the Immortal Gu House and leave this place.\n\nAll the feathermen gathered together and activated the immortal killer move heavenly wish.\n\n“I wish — my clan’s feathermen, survive!”\n\n“I wish — my clan’s feathermen, gain freedom!”\n\n“I wish — my clan’s feathermen, have a place to live in the world!”\n\nThe Western Desert Gu Immortals observed from the sidelines, letting the feathermen leave. Once the feathermen left, they could obtain the entire Immortal Gu House Sacred Feather City.\n\nIt was the first time Fang Yuan experienced this heavenly wish.\n\nHe felt a majestic and powerful white light engulfing him along with the rest of the feathermen, and transporting them through a white tunnel.\n\nHe felt he was like a piece of wood dropped into a rapid whirlpool, as he was sent revolving round and round.\n\nAfter about five minutes, the surrounding white light suddenly disappeared and Fang Yuan found his footing once again.\n\nHe was feeling extremely dizzy and almost fell to the ground.\n\nThe surrounding mortal feathermen were already sprawled on the ground.\n\nOnly the two featherman Gu Immortals, Zheng Ling and Zhou Zhong, were vigilantly standing.\n\nFang Yuan inwardly shook his head at this : “It seems that after enslaving Zhou Zhong, my own battle strength is not worth any expectations.”\n\n“Where is this place?” The featherman Gu Immortal Zhou Zhong scanned his surroundings.\n\nZheng Ling’s expression changed rapidly: “Not good! This is a human Gu Immortal’s blessed land! We were treated as an earthly calamity and transported here.”\n\nWith Tai Bai Yun Sheng at the lead, Hei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan slowly flew towards the feathermen.\n\nIn his previous life, Fang Yuan helped Tai Bai Yun Sheng to pass the tribulation and did not invite them.\n\nBut this life, Fang Yuan wanted to use this earthly calamity to intimidate them, so he invited them to help.\n\nTai Bai Yun Sheng was expressionless, feeling both shocked and joyous internally: “Fang Yuan looked for me to tell me he could deduce this calamity and told me what to do. I did not dare to believe him then, but now it seems everything is just like what he said. I can definitely pass this earthly calamity!”\n\nHei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan were both inwardly shocked.\n\nHaving a featherman calamity was rare and peculiar.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had actually accurately predicted it, what did this mean?!\n\nOne of the reasons it was difficult to pass heavenly tribulations and earthly calamities was that they could not be predicted.\n\nFang Yuan now had this ability, which was simply like a divine weapon to pass tribulations! As long as they made specific preparations before the tribulation, the probability of successfully passing the tribulation would be raised by a terrifying degree!\n\nThe featherman Gu Immortal Zheng Ling’s heart sank to rock bottom.\n\nIn his previous life, when he had seen Fang Yuan and Tai Bai Yun Sheng, he had a feeling of contempt.\n\nBut now, the rank seven Fairy Li Shan, Hei Lou Lan with the Great Strength True Martial Physique and Tai Bai Yun Sheng arrived together, especially the unconcealed aura of Immortal Gu on them, they involuntarily brought huge mental pressure on Zheng Ling.\n\nThere was nothing much to say after that.\n\nWith Tai Bai Yun Sheng displaying the ability of landscape as before Immortal Gu, the featherman Gu Immortals’ threat towards Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s immortal aperture had become non-existent.\n\nIn his previous life, just with Fang Yuan and Tai Bai Yun Sheng, these feathermen had been duped over and over.\n\nThis time, not only was there Hei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan, Zhou Zhong and Yu Fei were also hidden traitors.\n\nAfter a duel, Zheng Ling was once again killed, but Tai Bai Yun Sheng and the others did not force the remaining feathermen.\n\nThis was a mistake Fang Yuan had made last time.\n\nThis time, he would not make it again.\n\nThese feathermen were different from those feathermen sold in the markets. They lived in the immemorial green heaven fragment world, living on for generations in isolation from the rest of the world. They had the nature of the ancient feathermen, they would rather suicide than lose their freedom.\n\nThus, Tai Bai Yun Sheng did not restrict them, instead negotiating with them deceptively.\n\nUnder the lead of Zhou Zhong and ‘Yu Fei’, the feathermen moved to Star Form blessed land.\n\nWith these feathermen, Fang Yuan’s development in Western Desert could reach a new stage, and his prospects were bright.\n\nThis was not his only harvest.\n\nAfter the event, Hei Lou Lan indirectly asked him regarding the prediction of the calamity.\n\nFang Yuan intentionally gave a bitter smile, asking back: “You think I have such an ability? Don’t forget, Purple Mountain True Monarch is my master, at the same time, Tai Bai Yun Sheng is also his disciple.”\n\nHei Lou Lan thought: “So it was indeed like this, this ability is too powerful, it is not something Fang Yuan can possess, so it was Purple Mountain True Monarch.”\n\nUnconsciously, Hei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan’s apprehension towards Purple Mountain True Monarch deepened further.\n\nFang Yuan was able to deal a heavy blow to them, this would be greatly beneficial to him in restricting Blazing Heaven Demoness in the future.\n\nIt was only that after he enslaved Zhou Zhong, his soul’s burden had become very heavy, and there was much difficulty in even refining dream path mortal Gu.\n\nThis intensified Fang Yuan’s desire towards Luo Po valley.\n\nLuo Po valley and Dang Hun Mountain, if he had both of them, then even if he was a layman in soul path, the foundation of his soul would increase rapidly!\n\nHowever, right now, it was still not the time to go to Luo Po valley.\n\nIn his previous life, Hei Cheng’s soul had ended up in Hei Lou Lan’s hands, much of the information obtained through soul searching had been shared with Fang Yuan as well.\n\nFang Yuan knew that currently, Luo Po valley had been remodeled into a secret stronghold by Shadow Sect, with large numbers of Gu formations arranged everywhere.\n\nEven in his previous life, when Feng Jiu Ge and the other Central Continent Gu Immortals had attacked Luo Po valley when no one was around, these Gu formations were able to hold them off until Qin Bai Sheng and the rest arrived.\n\nRight now, Luo Po valley was filled with Shadow Sect’s members, it was much more terrifying than a dragon’s den.\n\nFang Yuan needed to wait for the appropriate time."
