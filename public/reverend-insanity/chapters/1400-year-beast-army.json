The fins moved around as the shell swam in the darkness gently.\n\nCompared to year beasts, day Gu was much more common, it could be found anywhere in the five regions and two heavens.\n\nWhat got Feng Jiu Ge’s attention was the fact that the River of Time was filled with a vast number of day Gu, month Gu, and year Gu to begin with.\n\nThere were wild day Gu here, was there a tributary of the River of Time like he thought?\n\nTributaries of the River of Time were a commonly seen yet rare cultivation resource.\n\nCommonly seen because every Gu Immortal’s immortal aperture had a tributary of the River of Time, it allowed time to flow within the immortal aperture’s world.\n\nBut rare because inside the five regions and two heavens, there were few tributaries of the River of Time, yet their scale was much larger than those inside immortal apertures. Once they appeared, super forces would fight for them using great strength. If lone immortals found them, they would try to conceal them and use them to gain a fortune themselves.\n\nNot only were time path Gu worms needed by time path Gu Masters or Gu Immortals, they were very widely used in Gu refinement.\n\nFor example, day Gu, this rank three day Gu has three days worth of time in it.\n\nIf one had the relevant refinement path method, by expending this rank three day Gu, they could shorten the time needed for Gu refinement by three days.\n\nThere were also time path lifespan extension methods using day Gu, month Gu, and year Gu to increase lifespan. Of course, these methods had flaws and would carve time path dao marks in the person’s body. When these dao marks accumulated, they would not be able to use lifespan Gu in the future.\n\nBut lifespan Gu were hard to find, if one did not have any, and their lifespan was at its end, would they not use these methods?\n\n“If there is a tributary of the River of Time here, Shadow Sect must have found it and secretly hid it here.” Feng Jiu Ge continued to delve deeper.\n\nSoon, he saw more and more wild time path Gu worms.\n\nDay Gu, month Gu, year Gu and more.\n\nA white ripple of light appeared in front of Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nThis ripple was the size of a bed, it was like the ripples on the surface of a lake, completely silent.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge slowed down cautiously.\n\nThis was a ripple of time.\n\nA special phenomenon.\n\nLike wind in the desert, fog in the mountains, and rain from the sky.\n\nRipples of time were a natural phenomenon as well.\n\nAny life form which entered a ripple of time would be affected. Their time would become faster, they would grow older more quickly. They could also become slower, the world would seem to ‘move faster’ from their perspective.\n\nBut regardless of fast or slow, their lifespan would be shaved away.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge did not dare to test it, he slowed down and detoured around it.\n\nAfter leaving the ripple of time, Feng Jiu Ge let out a breath of air, he was even more certain now that there was a tributary of the River of Time here.\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals have already pointed out to him that Red Lotus’ true inheritance was hidden in the stone lotus islands, if Fang Yuan wanted to inherit it, he would need to enter the River of Time, and to get into the River of Time, the best way was to find a tributary of the River of Time.\n\nThis tributary of the River of Time was like an entrance, it had to be big enough to enter. The tributary of the River of Time in a Gu Immortal’s immortal aperture was not big enough.\n\nOnly a tributary of the River of Time in the five regions and two heavens had an almost similar rate at which time flowed as the River of Time, it could allow Gu Immortals to enter.\n\nMore and more ripples of time started to appear in front of Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nThe deeper he went, the larger the tunnel became.\n\nAt first, there were only a few time path mortal Gu, but they increased in numbers, when he got to the deepest part, there were Gu worm groups of at least a hundred per group.\n\nThe time path aura was getting denser, Feng Jiu Ge could even hear the sound of flowing water.\n\nNext, in his vision, he saw a long line.\n\nAs Feng Jiu Ge got closer, this line got larger, until it became the form of a river.\n\n“A tributary of the River of Time!” Feng Jiu Ge’s heart shook, it was indeed here.\n\n“But where are Fang Yuan and the others?” Feng Jiu Ge had just thought of this when a figure emerged from a ripple of time near him, pouncing at him.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge immediately dodged as bright light shined in his eyes.\n\nAn immortal killer move was instantly activated.\n\nSound path — Silence Surpasses Sound!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge cultivated sound path and aspired to create nine songs to represent everything in this world. He had already created seven songs currently, separation song was one of them.\n\nBut other than his seven songs, he also had other sound path methods.\n\nSound path killer move silence surpasses sound was one of them.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had practised it a lot, he was extremely familiar with it, his activation succeeded instantly.\n\nHe started to punch with his fist and strike with his palm, attacking the black shadow from a distance.\n\nThis was a killer move, with his fist as the drum fist, and his palm as the bell palm, it was the content of Spirit Affinity House’s Three Sounds true inheritance.\n\nWithin the Three Sounds true inheritance, other than drum fist and bell palm, there was also whistle finger. But Feng Jiu Ge had not learned it yet, he had only practised this with the aim of covering some shortages of methods in battle.\n\nThat huge shadow monster was growling from Feng Jiu Ge’s attacks.\n\nBut the strange thing was, its growling vanished the moment it opened its mouth.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s drum fist created drumming noises, while his bell palm created bell chimes. But at this moment, there was no sound produced here.\n\nSoon, Feng Jiu Ge had the upper hand, his attacks became fiercer as the monster became dazed from the attacks, it could not retaliate.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge also saw that the thing that assaulted him was a year beast.\n\nMonkey year beast.\n\nAnd it was only a desolate beast, it was not an ancient desolate beast. Otherwise, it would not be suppressed so easily.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge squinted.\n\nIn the River of Time, not only were there wild time path Gu worms, there were also wild beasts and plants. Year beasts were rare in the five regions, but they were common in the River of Time.\n\nBut…\n\nWas this desolate level year beast arranged by Fang Yuan, or was it truly wild?\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was considering this problem.\n\nThe answer to this would mean that Fang Yuan had either found his traces or not.\n\n“Year beast…” Fang Yuan watched the battle as he connected to treasure yellow heaven.\n\nIn treasure yellow heaven, there were actually people selling year beasts openly, this was very rare.\n\nFang Yuan was deeply enticed.\n\nThese year beasts were either desolate beasts or ancient desolate beasts, if he could buy them and enslave them, they would be a huge force.\n\nDon’t forget about his hundred and eighty slaves immortal killer move.\n\nBy then, using these year beasts and hundred and eighty slaves killer move, Fang Yuan could even enslave immemorial year beasts!\n\nEven though he lost the upper extreme heavenly eagle, if he could get immemorial year beasts, Fang Yuan would get another rank eight battle strength.\n\nBut the problem was, the seller wanted to make huge transactions.\n\nFang Yuan naturally wanted to buy all of the year beasts, but he was not the only one.\n\nHis greatest weakness was that he did not have enough funds, if he wanted to buy the year beasts, he would need to sell the desolate beast eagles and ancient desolate beast eagles he bought earlier.\n\nOf course, Fang Yuan could sell Immortal Gu.\n\nBut he would not do that unless he had no choice.\n\nDuring the battle of the dream realm, Fang Yuan had to do that to survive, but now, it was not a situation of life and death.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor was making his decision now.\n\nHe received many offers, but there were only three that moved him.\n\nOne directly offered immortal essence stones, a vast number of them, it was hard to imagine that someone would actually have so many immortal essence stones, even Thousand Transformations Ancestor was shocked.\n\nThe second one offered a lot of immortal materials of all kinds, what moved Thousand Transformations Ancestor was that among them were a lot of transformation path immortal materials.\n\nThe third buyer was also very sincere, he wanted to use eagle beasts to exchange for year beasts. Thousand Transformations Ancestor was currently cultivating a type of eagle transformation, this buyer’s offer suited him.\n\nWhile Thousand Transformations Ancestor was hesitating, one of the three buyers offered a new high price.\n\n“They are willing to offer Immortal Gu?!” Thousand Transformations Ancestor was shocked and surprised, he did not hesitate anymore, he agreed to the transaction.\n\nAll of the year beasts were sold to one Gu Immortal.\n\nThe transaction ended quickly, be it the buyer’s deep foundation and offer, or Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s quick decision, they were shocking.\n\nWestern Desert, inside the moving sand tunnel.\n\nChirp chirp chirp!\n\nThe monkey year beast screamed shrilly.\n\nBut its screams vanished due to Feng Jiu Ge’s killer move.\n\nIn this silent battle, the monkey year beast could not resist Feng Jiu Ge, it was brutally slaughtered.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge inspected and found that this monkey year beast was truly a wild desolate beast, he took it as his spoils of battle and kept it in his immortal aperture.\n\nThe entire battle only lasted for a short while.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had evidently not used his true power, eliminating a desolate level year beast was too simple.\n\nHe did not need to rest, he continued to travel towards the tributary of the River of Time.\n\nThe closer he got, the clearer the tributary of the River of Time became.\n\nRiver water was flowing, ripples were shining, the river was silently moving in this darkness.\n\nHowl! Howl!\n\nSuddenly, from the tributary of the River of Time, several year beasts flew out and attacked Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was slightly shocked.\n\n“I was discovered?” Earlier at that instant, he felt the aura of an immortal killer move.\n\nThe year beasts that attacked were quite powerful, there were five desolate level year beasts and three ancient year beasts!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge snorted, his battle intent surged.\n\nSince he was discovered, he no longer needed to restrain himself in battle.\n\n“Come out Fang Yuan.” Feng Jiu Ge lightly called out.\n\nBut at the next moment, his pupils shrunk.\n\nMore year beasts were coming out from the tributary of the River of Time. In an instant, there were more than ten year beasts.\n\nAnd more were continuing to attack as they came out of the tributary of the River of Time!\n\n“What is going on? Is there a group of year beasts near this tributary of the River of Time?”"
