The first was to find the culprit behind the collapse of Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, the person who activated Central Continent’s arrangements in advance. The second one was to collect as many Immortal Gu as he could. To achieve this target, the Central Continent Gu Immortals prepared many methods.\n\nOne of the ways was to exchange Gu, thus they brought along many Immortal Gu from their sects.\n\nAfter all, Gu worms were hard to snatch. A Gu Master can destroy their own Gu worms in an instant with just a thought. The same applied to Immortal Gu.\n\nThe Immortal Gu that they brought over were mostly from unpopular paths, like strength path, qi path, and others.\n\nIntelligence on Northern Plains was always in the grasps of the ten great ancient sects. Qin Bai Sheng had not concealed the matter of him holding the auction, he even promoted it greatly. Thus, Feng Jiu Ge and the others had heard about this even when they were in Central Continent.\n\nIt could be said that Feng Jiu Ge’s appearance in the auction was not a last minute decision, he had planned for it long ago.\n\nIn the current world, strength path was not doing well, it had been weakening, those with enough wealth and ambition would certainly not choose to cultivate in strength path.\n\nUsing these Gu worms to exchange for Gu worms of other paths, to the ten sects, this was a form of victory.\n\nAlthough the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal was a rank eight great expert, when they truly competed, he still lost to Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nAfter all, Feng Jiu Ge was backed by the ten great ancient sects. Meanwhile, the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal entered Northern Plains secretly and attended this auction, it was his personal matter.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had the resolution to do a two for one exchange, but he did not.\n\nBut he was not resigned.\n\nHe made a final effort, bidding: “I will add… a sandalwood sacred elephant egg!”\n\nA small commotion occurred in the hall again.\n\n“A sandalwood sacred elephant is an ancient desolate beast, after it grows to adulthood, it can rival rank seven Gu Immortals.”\n\n“The most important thing is to raise it from a young age, establishing a deep relationship, there would be a low chance of betrayal.”\n\n“A living ancient desolate beast’s value is very high. If managed well, it is like a treasure trove with endless value. The blood of the sacred elephant is a good immortal material, the tusks of the sacred elephant will grow back even if they are removed.”\n\n“The Gu Immortal in the first secret room is using another approach. This is quite impressive, an Immortal Gu versus an ancient desolate beast, comparing the two, they each have their advantages and disadvantages, it is hard to decide.”\n\n“Immortal Gu are indeed unique, but ancient desolate beasts are useful too. Especially when the seller seems to have interest in refinement path, he might be moved and choose the ancient desolate beast.”\n\nThe people discussed.\n\nAt this point, Feng Jiu Ge and the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal stopped bidding.\n\nThe situation was uncertain now.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was exchanging two for one, he had great resolution and had a better chance. But the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal’s offer was similarly enticing, he had a chance of victory too.\n\nAs the auction hall turned silent, everyone was waiting for Fang Yuan’s decision.\n\nThis was an unexpected climactic moment of the auction, how would it end, who would be the winner that obtains worldly wave trace Immortal Gu?\n\nEveryone was waiting in anticipation.\n\nFang Yuan thought about it before making his decision, informing Qin Bai Sheng secretly.\n\nQin Bai Sheng nodded, announcing publicly: “The seller has decided, they will sell worldly wave trace Immortal Gu to Fairy You Lan!”\n\nOnce he said that, everyone breathed out in relief, starting their discussions.\n\n“It was logical that Fairy You Lan won.”\n\n“It was a two for one trade after all.”\n\n“If it was me, I would choose the ancient desolate beast. After all, the immortal essence expenditure of using two Immortal Gu is high.”\n\n“Which lucky person does this worldly wave trace Immortal Gu belong to? He actually sold it for such a good price, one Immortal Gu in exchange for two!”\n\n“Indeed, if I had not witnessed this personally, I would never believe it.”\n\n“Fairy You Lan, or rather, Prince Feng Xian definitely has other objectives. They are not fools, since they are offering such a high price, then the benefits they can gain must also be higher!”\n\n“As long as there is demand, there is a market, and profits can be gained. The greater the demand, the greater the profit.”\n\nNot just them, even Fang Yuan was trying to decipher the reason why ‘Swordmaster You Lan’ was buying worldly wave trace Immortal Gu at such a high price.\n\n“Prince Feng Xian…” The Eastern Sea Gu Immortal muttered this name as his expression turned slightly dark.\n\nAs the auction continued, an earth path Immortal Gu appeared next.\n\nBut the atmosphere was far beneath that of earlier, most of the Gu Immortals were still thinking about the earlier situation, they were still discussing it.\n\nWhat was the meaning of affluence and wealth, they had finally seen it clearly.\n\nEven though many people were suspicious, why would Prince Feng Xian, a fire path cultivator, be interested in a water path Immortal Gu?\n\nBut the mind of a rank eight great expert was hard to decipher, it was not something an outsider could guess so easily.\n\nA mainstream path Immortal Gu was rapidly sold after several rounds of bidding, the quick deal gave people a relatively boring feeling.\n\nTowards this, Qin Bai Sheng was helpless, he could only smile bitterly.\n\nAfter the climax, it would be the downturn. After all, Feng Jiu Ge and the Eastern Sea Gu Immortal’s bids were too imposing, it weakened a lot of the Gu Immortals’ desires to bid.\n\nFang Yuan sat in a secret room, playing with the two strength path Immortal Gu as he paid attention to the auction.\n\nTransactions involving Immortal Gu were done on the spot.\n\nFang Yuan looked through those immortal materials, he checked that there was no issue with the quantity.\n\nThrough Feng Jiu Ge’s cooperation, the two strength path Immortal Gu were completely refined by Fang Yuan, they were now his.\n\nAt the same time, worldly wave trace Immortal Gu was in Feng Jiu Ge’s hands.\n\n“This is worldly wave trace Immortal Gu… after so many years, it is finally back in Spirit Affinity House’s hands.” Feng Jiu Ge sighed softly, he felt some emotions.\n\nAs Immortal Gu were auctioned off one by one, as time passed, the atmosphere of the auction hall became heated once again.\n\n“Next is the thirty-fourth auction item, strength path Immortal Gu — Cauldron Strength, this is a rare strength path defensive Immortal Gu. Once activated, it can create a strength cauldron, protecting oneself. The seller wants a wisdom path Immortal Gu.” Qin Bai Sheng said.\n\nMost of the Gu Immortals in the hall had little interest.\n\nStrength path was declining, few people cultivated it, thus its demand in the market was small.\n\nJust as the owner of cauldron strength Immortal Gu was anxious, a hoarse and unique voice came from a single room: “Wisdom path Immortal Gu Loving Affection.”\n\n“This voice, it’s Domination Immortal Chu Du!” Immediately, someone in the hall shouted.\n\n“That’s right, it should be him, his voice is hoarse like this.”\n\n“To think that Domination Immortal came.”\n\n“What is so strange about it, Lord Chu Du is a famous strength path expert, why would Qin Bai Sheng not invite him?”\n\n“Domination Immortal Chu Du…” In a single room, Feng Jiu Ge drank his tea as his eyes shined.\n\nBefore he came to Northern Plains, he had obtained some information. The information regarding Domination Immortal Chu Du was rich and had a lot of details, Feng Jiu Ge placed great emphasis on him.\n\nChu Du was a rare strength path Gu Immortal, not only did he have great battle strength, he even had overflowing talent, creating a side branch of strength path personally.\n\nStrength path was a huge path, it had once flourished. Right now, strength path was split into beast strength phantom branch, atmospheric heaven and earth branch, as well as human strength jun strength branch.\n\nThe beast strength phantom branch included bull strength, tiger strength and others, the strength path Immortal Gu, iron crown eagle strength Gu, that Fang Yuan had obtained some time ago was in this branch.\n\nAtmospheric heaven and earth branch was the strength of nature, like wind strength, water strength, fire strength and others. Or for example, Pulling Mountain and Pulling Water that Fang Yuan obtained from selling worldly wave trace Immortal Gu, both belonged to this branch.\n\nHuman strength jun strength branch referred to the jin strength Gu, strength of ten jin Gu, jun strength Gu, strength of ten jun Gu, strength of hundred jun Gu and others.\n\nThis small branch was created solely by Chu Du, he brought strength path onto another track and revitalized this dying path using his own methods.\n\nRight now, the human strength jun strength branch was already the mainstream strength path cultivation in Northern Plains. All the Gu Masters in Northern Plains had a strength path foundation, they had all used jin strength Gu, strength of ten jin Gu, jun strength Gu, strength of ten jun Gu and others.\n\nOne could say that Domination Immortal Chu Du had singlehandedly turned around the situation of strength path, affecting all of the Gu cultivator paths in the world.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge naturally had to pay a lot of attention to such a person, in fact, it was particularly great emphasis.\n\n“Northern Plains is constantly engaged in battles, it is also a place where heroes emerge. If there is a chance, I have to meet this Domination Immortal.” Feng Jiu Ge’s mouth curled into an excited smile.\n\nMeeting all of the heroes in this world, that was the ambition of a true man!\n\nAt this time, a voice echoed: ” Delight in water and mountain Immortal Gu, and five thousand kilograms of cloud soil.”\n\nGuh.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge spat out the tea in his mouth, his eyes stared widely as he lost his calm.\n\n“Delight in water and mountain Immortal Gu!” He shouted: “Damn it, my worry came true.”\n\nImmortal Gu could be placed up for auction, they could naturally be used to trade for other Immortal Gu as well. If not for this, all of the registered Immortal Gu would be held up and not available for trade, this would greatly affect the auction’s success.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge understood this rule, and thus he was worried about it.\n\nWhatever you worried about was bound to happen.\n\nFang Yuan wanted strength path Immortal Gu, he had been paying attention to this strength path Immortal Gu since long ago. Right now, he offered delight in water and mountain Immortal Gu, this was part of his original plan.\n\n“One heaven pillar wind.” Facing Fang Yuan’s competition, Domination Immortal Chu Du raised his offer.\n\nHeaven pillar wind was quite special, it originated from green heaven. It was like a tall pillar, extremely tall and long. When it blows, it will not cause movement, only blowing on the spot, from outside, it resembled a giant pillar that extended into the sky.\n\nOne heaven pillar wind had high value, it did not lose to Feng Jiu Ge’s earlier bid of a hundred and fifty thunder sound leaves.\n\n“Domination Immortal Chu Du…” Fang Yuan muttered, immediately understanding: “It seems that you are my biggest competitor this time!”"
