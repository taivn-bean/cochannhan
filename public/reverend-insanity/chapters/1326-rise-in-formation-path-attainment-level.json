And the water path Gu worm spanned the distance of a hand below the formation heart Gu, continuously moving up and down.\n\nThe Gu formation made by these Gu worms emitted a hazy white light that shrouded the panther.\n\nThat’s right.\n\nThis Gu formation was an entrapment Gu formation targeted at the panther, and did not protect the Gu Master themselves.\n\nConstructing it was not easy. The panther continuously moved around, influencing the construction of the Gu formation. Occasionally, Fang Yuan had to stop and wait for the panther to move away from a specific location 1 .\n\nThis was also the reason why Tu Shi Cheng gave five minutes, Fang Yuan needed the time to arrange the formation.\n\n“Hahaha, good, you are indeed my son! You will continue to study with me in the following days. In a month, there will be an even stricter test which will concern your life and death. If you cannot pass, you shall die.” Tu Shi Cheng laughed, his laughter containing madness.\n\nFang Yuan’s young body was standing inside the cage, he glanced at the panther that was constantly struggling inside the Gu formation, and then glanced at Tu Shi Cheng, sighing softly.\n\nThis formation path dream realm’s second stage was passed.\n\nNext was the third stage.\n\nFang Yuan followed Tu Shi Cheng to a riverside where the tides were coming in fast.\n\nLooking at the water of this river that was flowing to the east and was red like blood, Fang Yuan immediately realized: this was Southern Border’s red dragon river.\n\nSouthern Border had three great rivers that passed through the whole region, red dragon river, jade dragon river and yellow dragon river.\n\nFang Yuan immediately had a bad feeling when he saw this river.\n\nSure enough, at the next moment, he heard Tu Shi Cheng’s voice: “I have already lent you the Gu worms, now you can only depend on yourself, if you cannot construct a Gu formation, you are well aware of the consequences.”\n\nFang Yuan was just about to speak to stall for time, but he was slapped on the back by Tu Shi Cheng.\n\nFang Yuan was simply unable to resist the enormous strength and was immediately pushed into red dragon river.\n\n“F\\*ck!” Fang Yuan cursed inwardly as he fell into the surging river and was immediately swept away by the current helplessly.\n\nFang Yuan struggled with all his might, he only had a young body, fortunately, Fang Yuan’s swimming ability was carried over, and after struggling for a while, he was able to raise his head out of the water and took in large breaths.\n\nMaking the best use of his time, Fang Yuan inspected the Gu worms he had.\n\n“Damn it!” Soon, he mentally cursed once again, because this time, it was not just the four mortal Gu like he expected, but twelve.\n\nHe had to arrange them in such a short period of time?\n\nThere were too many ways to arrange them, and under such terrible conditions, hope was slim.\n\nFang Yuan did not hesitate this time, and directly activated unravel dream!\n\nImmediately, an answer appeared in his mind.\n\nHe immediately understood the first three steps of how to activate the Gu worms and arrange the Gu formation.\n\n“Only the first three steps?” Fang Yuan had no choice but to continue to activate unravel dream, the fourth step, fifth step and sixth step also appeared in his mind.\n\nIt was an accurate and precise answer.\n\nBut there were still some steps from being able to construct the Gu formation.\n\nFang Yuan was just about to activate unravel dream for the third time, when suddenly a change occurred in the river, and he was swallowed by a whirlpool.\n\nBam, a muffled sound echoed.\n\nFang Yuan crashed head-first into a tree floating in the whirlpool, falling unconscious immediately.\n\nThe next moment, Fang Yuan woke up, he had returned to reality.\n\nHis soul was severely injured, making him see stars.\n\nHe quickly used guts Gu, one, two… six guts Gu before he finally recovered.\n\n“The third stage is even more difficult, the environment to arrange the formation is so hazardous.”\n\n“But…”\n\n“My formation path attainment has already advanced to quasi-master level.”\n\nAfter Fang Yuan realized it, he slowly opened his eyes with a trace of joy.\n\nWhat was attainment level?\n\nAttainment level was a Gu Master’s unique cognition, involving their sensations and experiences, their insights towards nurturing, using, refining Gu and so on, summed up and condensed. It was their comprehension of the Great Dao of heaven and earth.\n\nAttainment levels were divided into five levels, ordinary, master, grandmaster, great grandmaster and supreme grandmaster.\n\nNaturally, in-between these, there were small levels like quasi-master, quasi-grandmaster and quasi-great grandmaster.\n\nOrdinary attainment was the level that most Gu Masters would reach in their lifetimes.\n\nQuasi-master attainment was already rare. Young Gu Masters with outstanding aptitude or experienced old Gu Masters could reach this.\n\nMaster level was when the use of Gu worms went beyond superficial workmanship to the level of an art. It was rare to find even one master among ten thousand Gu Masters. For example, during the contest of Imperial Court, there were only five enslavement path masters – Jiang Bao Ya, Yang Po Ying, Ma Zun, Chang Shan Yin (Fang Yuan) and Nu Er Tu. Naturally, the one in ten thousand was referring to mortals, to rank six Gu Immortals, their main paths were this level at minimum.\n\nThose who possessed quasi-grandmaster attainment were often elites among rank six Gu Immortals.\n\nGrandmaster level was when one had a very profound grasp of the path, having deep foundations and being able to mimic the effects of other paths. Specifically, the main path’s Gu worms could be used to imitate the advantages of other paths. Hei Fan’s true inheritance had an immortal killer move, hundred years harmony, which was a classic example. It used time path Gu worms to produce an effect of information path. This also showed that Hei Fan’s time path attainment level was at least grandmaster.\n\nNormally speaking, there were few Gu Immortals that could attain grandmaster level. It often required a hundred years or even hundreds of years of accumulation, along with natural talent. In Fang Yuan’s first life, he had attained grandmaster in blood path only in the latter stage of his five hundred years of life.\n\nThose whom were able to have grandmaster attainment level were mostly rank seven Gu Immortals.\n\nAbove grandmaster was quasi-great grandmaster, which was even rarer, they were often rank seven experts or certain rank eights.\n\nAs for great grandmaster level, most rank eight Gu Immortals would attain this in their lifetimes.\n\nThose whom were able to attain quasi-supreme grandmaster were scarce, few produced even in thousands of years.\n\nThe rarity of supreme grandmasters need not be explained, for instance, in refinement path, there were only three supreme grandmasters in history. Among them was a hairy man — Long Hair Ancestor.\n\nFang Yuan’s formation path attainment level could not even be counted as ordinary, but now it had soared to quasi-master level.\n\nMost Gu Masters would find it difficult to reach this in their lifetimes, no matter how much effort they put in.\n\nFang Yuan had attained this just by using up a few days of time and exploring two stages of the dream realm.\n\nThis was the power of dream realms.\n\nThey contained true meaning, once a Gu Immortal successfully explored a dream realm and obtained the true meaning, their attainment level would be directly raised and their understanding of part of the Great Dao would be deepened.\n\n“Just two stages were enough to advance to quasi-master level in formation path, this dream realm is extraordinary.”\n\n“No wonder it has such difficulty.”\n\n“But I really haven’t heard of Tu Shi Cheng…”\n\nHis method of education was truly unique, leaving Fang Yuan speechless. But the person he was educating was this dream realm’s source. This youth was clearly a major character.\n\nFang Yuan could clearly sense he was only a step away from master level in formation path.\n\n“As long as I complete the third stage, my formation path attainment level will soar to master!”\n\nFang Yuan excitedly licked his lips.\n\nA successful exploration of the dream realm raised his foundation, this increase was so huge, allowing Fang Yuan to go through an extraordinary shortcut, and he was unable to stop desiring for more.\n\nBut since he had already left the dream realm, Fang Yuan was not in haste to go back in.\n\nHe recalled all the scenes in the third stage, especially the Gu worms with him.\n\nHe had only recognized sixty percent of them, thus he was now searching for information on these Gu worms to increase his understanding.\n\nThese were all mortal Gu, it was just that most of them had long since vanished in history.\n\nFang Yuan soon found the information he wanted, and gained an understanding of these mortal Gu.\n\nThen he began to re-read those mortal formation path inheritances he had bought before.\n\nThe feeling he got from reading this time was a completely different experience from before!\n\nPreviously, Fang Yuan only saw the surface of most of the contents of the inheritances, but now, he was able to see their deeper meanings with just one look. They were clearly things he had already read, but Fang Yuan made new discoveries this time.\n\nThis feeling was extremely mysterious, like sudden enlightenment.\n\nHowever, there were things which Fang Yuan could not completely comprehend.\n\nAfter all, he was only at quasi-master, some outstanding characters among mortal Gu Masters could reach master level. The inheritances they left behind naturally had some things Fang Yuan could not understand properly at the moment.\n\nFang Yuan was immersed in the profundity of formation path, unaware of the passing time.\n\nIf he was thirsty, he drank water, if he was hungry, he ate some fruits.\n\nMany thoughts emerged and disappeared like waves in his mind, he was using wisdom path methods to help quicken his progress of learning formation path.\n\nFormation path’s contents were truly vast, having connections with every path. Thus, it was considered the most complicated path.\n\nOnly when Wu An requested an audience did Fang Yuan slowly come back to his senses.\n\n“Unknowingly, eight days have already passed…” Fang Yuan was in a daze for a moment before his gaze slowly cleared up.\n\nIn his mind, most of the disordered thoughts gradually faded.\n\nFor the last ten days, Fang Yuan was lost in the learning process, not only did his formation path attainment level receive a boost, his comprehension of various basic contents of formation path had also strengthened.\n\n“What is he here for?” Fang Yuan impatiently furrowed his brows.\n\nBut after thinking for a moment, he still decided to see this Wu clan Gu Immortal.\n\nAs it turned out, Wu An brought over Lady White Rabbit, who reported the situation of the dream realm business and gave concrete accounts to Fang Yuan for inspection.\n\nDespite Fang Yuan not placing attention on this business, he was, after all, the leader of the whole business.\n\nAs a subordinate, Lady White Rabbit had to hand over the report."
