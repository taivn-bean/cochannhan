At this moment, the two troops engaged in battle and unleashed their killer moves, having no clear advantage on each side.\n\nSeeing his final trump card engaged in a deadlock, Hei Lou Lan’s expression turned pitch black.\n\n“Hehehe.” Liu Wen Wu laughed heartily, feeling great pleasure, his opponent was at his wit’s end, but he was in the same situation.\n\nHowever, the grass soldier army could still blok the mutated beast wolf group for some time. As for Hei tribe’s higher level battle force, they had already shown signs of collapsing, especially Gao Yang and Zhu Zai against Ouyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang, their battle was very obviously showing signs of a victor emerging.\n\nOuyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang, although they were not skilled at cooperating, they had greater individual strength than their opponents.\n\nIf Gao Yang and Zhu Zai were fighting two against one, using their great chemistry, they could have a mild advantage. But now, they could only be suppressed, defending desperately as they were in a passive situation.\n\nAnyone could tell that Gao Yang and Zhu Zai were going to fail very soon. Once they lose, Ouyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang would be like tigers out of a cage, they would start to reinforce other battles.\n\nThat way, their mild advantage will snowball and accumulate, allowing the entire battle to sway in his favor.\n\nOnce Liu tribe army gains the advantage, Hei tribe without any more backup would have no way of winning, they would only be able to watch their opponent grow stronger as they fall into a worse situation.\n\nEventually, the other side will turn advantage into victory, and Hei tribe army would crumble!\n\nHei Lou Lan could see the problem now, he was sweating profusely. He was all alone in the main tent, at this point, he could only rely on his own strength!\n\nHis body vanished in the main tent, appeared in the air above the grass soldier army.\n\nHe had the intention of killing Bei Cao Chuan, since Bei Cao Chuan did not have lurking soul coat Gu, he was easy to distinguish, once he is killed, the grass soldier army would crumble.\n\nThat way, this battle would go back into a double offense situation, at the end, it would be like the first battle, they would have to regroup and retreat.\n\nKiller move — Dark Vortex!\n\nHei Lou Lan had just activated his killer move, when a white light appeared before him, showing Liu Wen Wu’s body.\n\nHei Lou Lan was a dark path rank five, while Liu Wen Wu was a light path rank five, the two had engaged in combat for many times without a clear victor.\n\nBut this time, the gentleman-like Liu Wen Wu showed a mild smile of a victor: “Brother Lou Lan, today’s battle depends on a single ray of light. My grass soldier army is going to fall soon, but your higher level battle strength will falter more quickly. What a pity, our armies have very close battle strength, we are nearly evenly matched.”\n\n“You are courting death!” Hei Lou Lan shouted furiously, growling and charging at Liu Wen Wu.\n\nThe two fought as they moved around, exploding with thunderous sounds or brilliant lights.\n\n“Strange, in my previous life, Hei tribe defeated Liu tribe, but it seems that Liu tribe has the advantage now. Was it because of me that some weird changes occurred?” Fang Yuan hid at a corner as he secretly observed.\n\nHe was an enslavement-strength dual cultivator, he had not displayed his full strength yet.\n\nIn fact, he had not even displayed his full enslavement path abilities yet.\n\nAt this moment, the grass soldier army was barely holding on, he just had to show up and unleash the wolf howl Gu and rank five amplify effect Gu to instantly defeat Bei Cao Chuan.\n\nBut Fang Yuan did not move, he chose to observe.\n\nHis attention was on Ouyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang.\n\nOnce he showed up, and activated wolf howl Gu and rank five amplify effect Gu, there was a huge possibility that the two of them would come after him.\n\nTruthfully speaking, Fang Yuan was already accomplished in strength path, he was not afraid of fighting Ouyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang together in close combat.\n\nBut…\n\n“My vision cannot be limited to this battle. The fight for the Imperial Court is a competition among super tribes, a game manipulated by Gu Immortals. Once I expose my full strength, even if we win this battle, the other party will definitely target me when they get reinforced by their Gu Immortal. By then, I would have no more hidden trump cards left, my grasp over this situation would fall to rock bottom.”\n\nFang Yuan’s mind was on the Imperial Court, he kept calm at all times and was not disturbed by the dangerous situation ahead of him.\n\n“In my previous life, how did Hei tribe defeat Liu tribe? Although the battle is extremely tense now, both sides had not used their trump cards yet. At least I know that Tai Bai Yun Sheng has a rank five Gu ‘man as before’. The less battle strength I expose, the better it is for me. If I strike, it has to be a fatal blow! Now is not the time yet…”\n\nFang Yuan’s heart was calm, despite this intense battlefield that was filled with corpses and rivers of blood.\n\nIn his eyes, these casualties were just numbers.\n\nIn this battle, many people screamed at the deaths of their friends and family, many people shouted in joy after killing a strong foe, some Gu Masters ran away under the fear of death. Some Gu Masters were filled with ambition, wanting to be a person of higher status.\n\nHuman emotions became riled up in such moments of life and death, they were frenzied, crazy, while arrogant and unrestrained.\n\nObserving the ruthless expressions of the people around, hearing their screaming and shouting, Fang Yuan felt a great sense of serenity and peace.\n\nHis heart was firm like an ancient abyss, there were no ripples on the surface.\n\nFight, kill, a person is born to engage in battle.\n\nWin, lose, continue walking on your path, by stepping on other people’s corpses.\n\nLet blood boil, let sweat flow, the best moment of life is now…\n\n“Take this, this is my killer move — World Devouring Qi!” In the battlefield, an explosive and thunderous shout burst out.\n\nHis voice attracted numerous gazes as everyone subconsciously focused on it.\n\n“Oh no, let’s go!” An intense sense of danger assaulted him as Gao Yang shouted, activating his Gu worm and wanting to escape, but the surrounding air was as dense as walls, he could barely move.\n\nMo Shi Kuang floated in the air, opening his hands as his ten fingers converged before his chest.\n\nGao Yang and Zhu Zai felt a despairing sense of pressure, squashing them from all directions. Their shocked expressions froze on their faces, the feeling of imminent death filled their hearts.\n\n“Go!” Before the moment of death, Zhu Zai burst out the strength of three grand emperor boar, piercing a hole on the wall-like air.\n\n“Brother!” Gao Yang felt his world spinning, when he reacted, he had already been tossed far away by Zhu Zai, away from the battlefield.\n\nAs for Zhu Zai, he was squeezed into meat paste by Mo Shi Kuang’s killer move, through an intense and concentrated air pressure.\n\n“Brother!!” Gao Yang shouted, his heart felt like it was pierced by daggers as tears flowed out of his eyes like a flood.\n\nMo Shi Kuang also vomited a mouthful of blood.\n\n“Second brother, your killer move is not completed yet, don’t activate it casually.” Ouyang Bi Sang quickly hurried over and held him in the air.\n\nMo Shi Kuang vomited blood as he laughed: “What a great battle, I used it without thinking, hahaha…”\n\nOuyang Bi Sang shook his head: “Alright, let’s continue killing that Gao Yang, after we resolve the problem here, we will reinforce the other battles!”\n\nLiu Wen Wu who saw this laughed, he declared with overwhelming confidence: “This is the start of our Liu tribe army’s consecutive victories! Brother Lou Lan, you have no way of winning already!”\n\n“Is that so?” It was not Hei Lou Lan who replied him, but Tai Bai Yun Sheng who was at another battle ring.\n\nTai Bai Yun Sheng who had always been evading attacks suddenly burst out with great speed as he pulled some distance from his opponent, opening his palms and shooting out a silver beam.\n\nThe silver beam shone on Zhu Zai’s flesh and blood that became meat paste.\n\nRank five — Man As Before!\n\nIn an instant, silver light shone brilliantly, making people close their eyes in response.\n\nAfter the light faded, Zhu Zai reappeared on the battlefield, without any injuries on him, as his primeval sea level was also at its peak.\n\nUnder the effect of man as before, Zhu Zai returned to the state right before the battle!\n\nThe shocked expression not only appeared on multiple Gu Masters’ faces, even Liu Wen Wu, Mo Shi Kuang, and Ouyang Bi Sang had the same expression.\n\nMan as before Gu had an incredible healing effect that made almost everyone feel shocked and speechless!\n\nMan as before Gu, time path healing Gu, could return a target to his condition at a point in time.\n\n“Good, what a great healing Gu!” Hei Lou Lan laughed heartily, he did not expect Tai Bai Yun Sheng to be concealing such a strong trump card. As long as they had this, Hei tribe’s higher level battle could drag on for a long time.\n\n“Good, now is the time!” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone with brilliance as he activated rank four eagle rise Gu, flying up into the sky.\n\nRank five amplify effect Gu and rank four wolf howl Gu!\n\nFang Yuan opened his mouth and howled, as his voice spread far and wide.\n\nUnder the effect of the wolf howl Gu, all his mutated beasts’ bodies expanded, as their eyes turned bright red, their battle strength grew by five times!\n\n“Go.” Fang Yuan floated in the air, staring at the battlefield as he muttered.\n\nThe wolf tide burst out, like a tsunami out of nowhere!\n\n“Damn it, I can’t hold on!” Bei Cao Chuan was at his wit’s end, he resisted desperately, but the grass soldier army was like a thin piece of paper under the wolf tide, it was torn to shreds without even lasting for a few breath’s time.\n\nBei Cao Chuan did not even manage to escape before a frenzy wolf pounced on him and tore his armor with its sharp teeth, before biting his throat.\n\nBei Cao Chuan resisted with all his strength, sending this frenzy wolf flying, just as he was about to cover his neck and get up, three white-eyes wolves came and after a struggle, he was a corpse torn into several pieces.\n\nThe grass soldier army went down, Fang Yuan thus manipulated the wolf group and attacked grand white troops.\n\nGrand white troops were fighting with black banner troops, they were stuck in a stalemate as they exchanged blows. Now that the mutated beast wolf group attacked them from behind, they suffered heavy injuries.\n\n“Hahaha, Liu Wen Wu, it seems that I have the last laugh!” The battle turned in such a sudden direction, Hei Lou Lan was overjoyed and surprised.\n\n“No, I have not lost yet!” Liu Wen Wu’s face was distorted as he shouted frantically, like a gambler who had gone crazy from losing. He turned into a white light, flying towards Ouyang Bi Sang and Mo Shi Kuang.\n\n“Second brother, third brother!” He shouted."
