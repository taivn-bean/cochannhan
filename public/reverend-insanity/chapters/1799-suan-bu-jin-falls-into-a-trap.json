His soul was also injured and his physical body was surrounded by a strange green light that emitted wood path aura.\n\nFang Di Chang sighed as he looked at the giant palace in front of him.\n\nThis palace was lofty like a mountain, its green bricks and golden tiles emitted dense fragrance of plants and trees. There was solemnity but also liveliness. Carved on the plaque on the palace door were three large words — Divine Bean Palace!\n\n“This Immortal Gu House was created by Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable after all, it is comprehensive with no loopholes. I tried to deduce forcefully but suffered such a backlash, I underestimated a venerable’s power and was too hurried.” Fang Di Chang sighed.\n\n“Father, our Fang clan’s situation is not bad right now, we can take it slow.” Fang Yun comforted.\n\nFang Di Chang shook his head: “Although the situation is stabilized, it is still not optimistic. Those clans are restraining themselves because they are shaken by our theft path killer move, but they have never given up on pressuring us. We must grasp every second and cannot slack.”\n\n“Yes, father.”\n\nFang Di Chang looked at Divine Bean Palace and sighed again: “Sigh, it is unfortunate that our Fang clan does not have any wood path Gu Immortal. This Divine Bean Palace’s core is wood path. If there were a rank seven wood path Gu Immortal assisting me, I would have a lot more progress in deducing this Immortal Gu House.”\n\nWestern Desert was filled with deserts with oases decorating them, wood path and water path were the least cultivated paths in this region.\n\nAmong the five regions, Southern Border had the most wood path Gu Immortals, while Eastern Sea had the most water path Gu Immortals.\n\nFang Yun said after some thought: “Our Fang clan does not have a wood path Gu Immortal, but we have another wisdom path expert.”\n\n“You are talking about Suan Bu Jin?” Fang Di Chang’s gaze narrowed with a trace of vigilance flashing past it: “Did he ask you to recommend him?”\n\nFang Yun shook his head: “No, no, I am saying this myself. Lord Suan Bu Jin never signaled me, and in fact, after joining the clan, he has always stayed outside and never contacted me.”\n\nFang Di Chang’s face relaxed only then: “Suan Bu Jin is not of Fang clan after all, although he joined our clan, we need to keep this in mind.”\n\n“Father, you doubt Lord Suan Bu Jin’s loyalty?” Fang Yun scratched his head.\n\nFang Di Chang narrowed his eyes: “If I had his help, there would indeed be progress. But we can know a man’s face but not his heart\\[1\\], especially in front of such an unmatched treasure like Divine Bean Palace. Even if he did not show this intention before, when he is in contact with this palace day and night, it is hard to not have greed.”\n\nFang Di Chang was still not assured, asking: “Are there any movements from Suan Bu Jin recently?”\n\nFang Yun replied truthfully: “There are no movements. However, there are rumors targeting Lord Suan Bu Jin that says he is actually the inheritor of Old Man Lie Shen, a demonic descendant who was recruited by our clan. It is also rumored Wan clan will investigate this matter and verify Lord Suan Bu Jin’s identity.”\n\nFang Di Chang snorted: “These people are still trying to frame Suan Bu Jin! But this excuse has some substance to it, it is at least slightly more realistic than the previous rumor that said he was the demon Fang Yuan.”\n\nFang Di Chang sneered, having no idea that the previous rumor was actually truth, it was instead the recent rumor that was twisting the truth.\n\nOld Man Lie Shen was a Wan clan wisdom path Gu Immortal but because of an accident while cultivating, he lost himself and became a lunatic. He had rank seven cultivation and his strength increased even further after going crazy, he caused huge losses to Wan clan and even slaughtered Gu Immortals of other righteous path forces.\n\nIt led to an uproar during that period of time in Western Desert’s Gu Immortal world, several righteous path forces allied to besiege and kill Old Man Lie Shen. But no matter what they did, they could find no traces of Old Man Lie Shen, he had disappeared completely and this matter was left unresolved.\n\nFang Di Chang said deeply: “Suan Bu Jin has outstanding strength, he understands this kind of cheap trick. But it has not been long since he joined Fang clan, so it is normal for him to be regarded as a weakness of Fang clan. We need to pay attention to him and let him stay in heavenly dew oasis, we can’t let him make any rash moves that could give the enemies a hold on him. As for his identity, our Fang clan will clear it for him and give a perfect explanation to Western Desert’s righteous path.”\n\nThe moment he finished speaking, Fang Di Chang’s expression changed.\n\nFang Yun saw the change and asked: “What happened?”\n\nFang Di Chang’s pale and weak face now had a trace of an ashen look: “Suan Bu Jin sent a letter saying he reverse-deduced and found a wisdom path Gu Immortal nearby who is likely to be the one who spread the rumors, he has already gone to catch them.”\n\nFang Yun was stupefied: “What?!”\n\nAccording to the rules, Gu Immortals who were stationed to guard resources would have to report to the clan if they wanted to move out. They could only move after the clan approved of it.\n\nBut Suan Bu Jin’s action was the opposite, he moved first before reporting. Whether Fang clan agreed or not, he had left his stationed area and moved out.\n\n“He is a lone cultivator in the end, his nature is wild!” Fang Di Chang gritted his teeth, as it so happened, he was heavily injured and could not deduce much at this moment.\n\nHe could only contact Fang clan’s first supreme elder Fang Gong and let him go reinforce Suan Bu Jin as quickly as possible.\n\nFang Yun was slightly puzzled: “The situation might not be so bad. Aren’t we making too much fuss by sending first supreme elder as reinforcement? Lord Suan Bu Jin is a wisdom path Gu Immortal, he must have definitely deduced before moving out and has confidence to handle this matter.”\n\nFang Di Chang’s expression was dark: “Suan Bu Jin is indeed extraordinary, but he is prideful and this could be used by others to scheme against him. It would be terrible if those righteous path forces intentionally lured him and set a series of traps. If he is captured or killed, those clans could forge ironclad evidence and frame our Fang clan, then further suppress our clan.”\n\n“Naturally, this is only a possibility, let’s just hope it is only me being pessimistic. More importantly, our Fang clan cannot make such a mistake at this crucial time.”\n\nFang Yun came to a realization and his expression also turned unsightly. He gave a forced smile: “It should not be that serious, right?”\n\nBut the matter was that serious!\n\nWhen Fang Yuan reached the place, wisdom path Gu Immortal Wan Liang Han had a leisurely expression: “Suan Bu Jin, you finally arrived, I waited for quite a while.”\n\nThe moment he finished speaking, the prepared immortal battlefield activated and trapped Fang Yuan.\n\n“So it was a trap!” Fang Yuan, who was disguised as Suan Bu Jin, sneered. His gaze shone as he looked at the three Gu Immortals approaching him.\n\nThese three Gu Immortals were all rank seven.\n\nOne was tall and thin, dressed in a green robe, and surrounded by whirlwinds. His name was Wan Xiao. He spoke confidently: “Suan Bu Jin, how can you even be a wisdom path Gu Immortal! You actually jumped into our trap so easily.”\n\nThe second Gu Immortal Wan Hao Guang’s appearance could not be seen, his whole body was covered with light armor that emitted extremely high heat. The thick light armor emitted buzzing noises: “Suan Bu Jin, if you are sensible, then let yourself be captured, side with our Wan clan and expose Fang clan, we won’t make it difficult for you and even treat you as an honored guest!”\n\nThe third Gu Immortal was the wisdom path Gu Immortal who lured Fang Yuan, he was Wan Liang Han. His forehead was swollen and had an ugly appearance, but was smiling right now: “Friend Suan Bu Jin, as a wisdom path Gu Immortal, you should be even more aware of the current situation. Even if you survive today, there will be endless troubles coming to find you in the future. You should not be in Fang clan at such a time.”\n\nFang Yuan sneered with a ruthless expression.\n\nHis disguised appearance Suan Bu Jin looked skinny with long grey hair and a pair of black eyes which seemed to contain vicissitudes of life and ambition. He was trapped inside the immortal battlefield and also heard the three immortals’ words, but there were no change in his expression.\n\nThis was only natural!\n\nBecause Fang Yuan had concealed his strength, not only just these three rank sevens, even if there were three rank eights, he would be fearless and even happy.\n\nThe three Wan clan immortals thought they had trapped Fang Yuan, little did they imagine Fang Yuan returned from Southern Border this time to especially deal with them and create a commotion in Western Desert!\n\nIn the recent period of time, Wan Liang Han had been repeatedly deducing Fang Yuan, Fang Yuan had emperor yama’s protection that had no flaws, but this still reduced his soul foundation and it was quite annoying, so he had to get rid of them this time.\n\nFang Yuan immediately opened his immortal aperture’s entrance and released soul beasts.\n\nDesolate soul beasts and ancient soul beasts came out one after the other, shocking Wan clan’s immortals.\n\nWas he not a wisdom path Gu Immortal? How could he control so many soul beasts?\n\n“No matter how many soul beasts you bring out, it is useless in this immortal battlefield!” Wan Xiao activated the immortal battlefield, a giant tornado immediately sprang up and slowly moved towards Fang Yuan.\n\nSoul beasts were densely packed around Fang Yuan and following his gradual mobilization, the quantity kept on increasing.\n\n“How can he have so many soul beasts?” Wan clan’s three immortals were increasingly shaken, this Suan Bu Jin was clearly a wisdom path Gu Immortal but actually controlled such a huge soul beast army, wasn’t he neglecting his main path too much?\n\nThe tornado’s speed became even faster and neared Fang Yuan’s soul beast army.\n\nSoul beasts roared and counterattacked, but the tornado seemed to have heavenly might in this immortal battlefield. Although it was weakened, it was extremely stable.\n\nFang Yuan personally activated a killer move to block the tornado.\n\nWan clan’s three immortals’ shock slightly decreased when they saw the killer move.\n\nFang Yuan used a wisdom path killer move instead of a soul path killer move.\n\n“It won’t do like this, he seems to have an endless amount of soul beasts. I will attack!” Wan Hao Guang shouted.\n\n“Go, we will protect you.” Wan Liang Han agreed.\n\nWan Hao Guang killed his way through the soul beast army, he was extremely fast, fully showing the superiority of light path.\n\nEvery time Fang Yuan mobilized the soul beast army to besiege him, Wan Liang Han and Wan Xiao activated killer moves to protect Wan Hao Guang.\n\nWith their excellent coordination, Wan Hao Guang broke through to the center.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression did not change as he let out another four soul beasts.\n\n“Huh?” Wan Hao Guang’s momentum paused violently as he blurted out in fright: “Immemorial soul beasts!”\n\nWan Liang Han and Wan Xiao were dazed, both calling out in an incredulous tone: “Four?”\n\n\\[1\\] Even if you are physically close to someone, you cannot know what he is thinking."
