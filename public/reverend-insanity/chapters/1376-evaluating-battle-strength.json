Fang Yuan had obtained these eagle nests by looting the headquarters of Northern Plains’ Hei tribe, Iron Eagle blessed land.\n\nThere were ordinary baby eagles in the nests that were still growing.\n\nUsing Hei tribe’s method of raising, after these baby eagles matured, they would likely become desolate eagles or even ancient desolate eagles.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan had already used time path methods to slow down the rate of time in the sovereign immortal aperture. This led to these baby eagles growing up very slowly.\n\nAs such, Fang Yuan would have to wait a long time for them to grow up into desolate eagles or ancient desolate eagles.\n\n“For now, it is better to buy from outside.”\n\n“The more eagle beasts I have, the more control I would have over the upper extreme heavenly eagle. Right now, I have over four hundred eagles, but I can just barely control it and can only order it to fly.”\n\n“It is not a big problem to make it fight against weak opponents, but it won’t obey if I order it to fight strong enemies like Zuo Ye Hui, there is even a possibility of backlash.”\n\nNow that they had escaped from the battlefield, Fang Yuan could calmly think.\n\nIt was not just this, Fang Yuan also needed to consider and deal with the issues of what these desolate eagles and ancient desolate eagles ate, and what influence they would have to their surroundings.\n\nTo raise these eagle beasts, Fang Yuan would need a large amount of basic life forms to feed them. This meant he would have to build a complete food chain, and this food chain had to be of a large scale!\n\n“Fortunately, my sovereign immortal aperture has a very large space, it is more than enough for this large group of eagle beasts. Moreover, the territory is vast but the population is sparse, I can construct independent ecologies without worrying about them being influenced by the inherent environment. It is like a piece of white paper that can be easily painted.”\n\n“I am quite well-off right now, with over a hundred thousand immortal essence stones, purchasing and raising the eagle beasts is only one aspect, the other thing is to improve reverse flow protection seal!”\n\nFang Yuan had become the leader of Shadow Sect after the giant dream realm incident.\n\nThis greatly surpassed his expectations.\n\nShadow Sect had lost badly, Spectral Soul’s main body was captured, leading Fang Yuan to become the biggest eyesore to Heavenly Court.\n\nEven if Fang Yuan did not accept the leadership, he would still be targeted by Heavenly Court.\n\nJust like Purple Mountain True Monarch said, Fang Yuan was a complete otherworldly demon, Heavenly Court absolutely needed to kill him!\n\nAs such, Fang Yuan might as well accept the responsibility over Shadow Sect.\n\n“Wait until I have complete control over the upper extreme heavenly eagle and an improved reverse flow protection seal, I would then have some ability to defend myself against Heavenly Court.”\n\nAs he thought of this, Fang Yuan could not help but think of that majestic Heaven Overseeing Tower, as well as that domineering quasi-rank nine expert Duke Long.\n\nA formless pressure inevitably spread in Fang Yuan’s mind.\n\n“I am still too weak! Even though I have reverse flow protection seal protecting me, it can only let me stand in front of rank eights and block their attacks. But if they attack endlessly, Reverse Flow River will be completely consumed in the end.”\n\n“Even though I have the immemorial desolate beast upper extreme heavenly eagle, it does not have enough intelligence and is not as convenient as me making a move myself. Moreover, hundred and eighty slaves… this enslavement path killer move can be unraveled.”\n\n“Sigh, my strength is actually increasing rapidly. But what I am facing is Heavenly Court, the strongest Gu Immortal force in the whole world.”\n\n“I need to devour immortal apertures and increase my cultivation level quickly. I can take a slight breather when I am at rank eight, rank seven cultivation is too low! But if I advance to rank eight, the sovereign immortal body’s flaw will enlarge, it is hard to resolve.”\n\nFang Yuan was facing a dilemma.\n\n“It is difficult for me to raise my strength, under this situation, do I rely on them?” Fang Yuan’s gaze scanned around.\n\nYing Wu Xie, Bai Ning Bing, Hei Lou Lan, Black Tigress, Fairy Miao Yin as well as many Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch had left behind information path Gu worms in his inheritance which recorded these people’s situations in detail.\n\nFang Yuan had also just read them.\n\nThe Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies were all defective goods, Purple Mountain True Monarch had refined them only as a veil to cover the actions of Spectral Soul’s main body.\n\nThese Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies contained remnant souls of Purple Mountain True Monarch.\n\nUnfortunately, after they were refined, the remnant souls had merged into the Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies, unable to be separated. The Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies had a time limit, and when that limit was reached, they would self-detonate into dream realms, and these Purple Mountain remnant souls would disappear along with them.\n\nThis defect could not be resolved even if Purple Mountain True Monarch came back to life.\n\nThis was also the reason why Spectral Soul’s main body had never put its soul into these Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies.\n\nYing Wu Xie had also obtained a rank seven Pure Dream Reality Seeker body from a cocoon of light, but he was an exception.\n\nBecause he was once the original Pure Dream Reality Seeker, so the flaw of these defective goods did not affect him.\n\nHis soul could still freely leave the Pure Dream Reality Seeker bodies.\n\nAs such, although there were many of these Pure Dream Reality Seeker immortals, they were not worth nurturing. (Fang Yuan had also captured nearly ten using the super Gu formation, but they were all released now since they had become his own men).\n\nFang Yuan had originally prepared to put in a lot of effort to research and study this dream path attainment of Shadow Sect, but now that he had Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance, he understood them all, saving countless hours of research and trials.\n\nThe remaining five Gu Immortals were the true manpower that Fang Yuan could use.\n\n“Currently, the strongest is undoubtedly Bai Ning Bing, who has inherited Bai Xiang’s true inheritance, unfortunately, we are only allies.”\n\n“Fairy Miao Yin cultivates the Profound Sound true inheritance, she is one of the three great fairies of Southern Border and is a rank seven, her battle strength is reliable.”\n\n“Black Tigress…” Just as Fang Yuan thought of this, dense black fog started to pour out from Black Tigress’s whole body.\n\nThe fog was immediately blown away by the strong wind.\n\nThe black fog dissipated, revealed a girl with tender skin and large watery eyes.\n\nHer whole face was covered with innocence, Lady White Rabbit was back.\n\n“Lord Wu Yi Hai… no, what should I call you?” Lady White Rabbit asked Fang Yuan with a servile tone.\n\nHei Lou Lan, Bai Ning Bing, and the others looked at her in astonishment\n\nAfter recovering, Lady White Rabbit’s cultivation fell from rank seven to rank six. This situation was truly hard to understand.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan had inherited Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance and understood this Black Tigress true inheritance.\n\nA Gu Immortal who cultivated this true inheritance would normally accumulate strength and burst out with outstanding battle strength when in a fight, beyond their usual limits.\n\nHowever, there was a flaw in it, the user would develop two personalities; one was a dark, sinister side, and the other was a pure, innocent side.\n\nThe Gu Immortal would have the pure, innocent nature when living a normal life, having weak strength. When they face danger to their life or their mood gets intensely agitated, they would turn to the dark, sinister nature. This dark side had strong battle strength, but could only be maintained for a short period of time.\n\nBoth sides shared the same senses and memories, but they usually had different thought processes.\n\nHowever, this was not a problem to Fang Yuan.\n\nBecause Lady White Rabbit already admired Wu Yi Hai, while Black Tigress was recruited by Purple Mountain True Monarch to be a member of Shadow Sect.\n\nNo matter which side it was, they were both loyal to Fang Yuan.\n\n“Don’t be afraid. I also had my own problems, so I had to hide my true identity from you. You can call me Fang Yuan.” Fang Yuan warmly smiled at Lady White Rabbit.\n\nLady White Rabbit seemed to be unable to accept it completely, as she acknowledged timidly.\n\nFang Yuan sighed inwardly: “Black Tigress has first rate battle strength among rank seven, but it is not stable. Now, only Hei Lou Lan and Ying Wu Xie remain.”\n\n“Hei Lou Lan is the most ‘loyal’, but she only has rank six cultivation. She has the Great Strength True Martial Physique, but this natural talent is wasted by cultivating fire path, and she is bent on avenging her mother. Relying on the exquisite Blazing Heaven true inheritance, her battle strength can barely reach first rate in rank seven, but she is definitely the weakest.”\n\n“As for Ying Wu Xie…”\n\nFang Yuan gazed at Ying Wu Xie, who was slumped down on the back of the eagle and was looking at the sky with a dazed look.\n\nHe seemed to have had his back removed, his whole body was limp like jelly, and his expression was extremely dark.\n\nFang Yuan shook his head.\n\nActually, Ying Wu Xie, who possessed lead soul into dream, could erupt with battle strength that could stably occupy the number one position in strength. Even Fang Yuan had to be apprehensive of him.\n\nBut such a person had no fighting spirit left, even if he had lead soul into dream, what could one hope from him?\n\n“Ying Wu Xie, hand over all your Gu worms to me.” Fang Yuan suddenly spoke.\n\nYing Wu Xie did not speak, there was no response as if he was a statue.\n\nFang Yuan’s voice became sharp: “Ying Wu Xie, I am the leader of Shadow Sect, are you disobeying me?”\n\nYing Wu Xie did not budge, his heart seemed to be withered in grief.\n\nA sharp light flashed past Fang Yuan’s eyes, and he was just about to take action when suddenly, a strong pressure erupted from overhead.\n\nAn Immortal Gu House appeared.\n\n“Shadow Sect remnants, Yi clan is here, where do you think you are escaping to?!”"
