They were all different now, having being elevated to a whole new level, they were already on par with the five regional walls that existed in the past.\n\nBack then when Tao Zhu researched on the five regional walls, he created the methods of five regional limit formation and five restriction profound light qi.\n\nFang Yuan used the foundation of his life’s research and made a breakthrough, he reached a height that Tao Zhu had never seen in his life.\n\nFang Yuan had the sovereign immortal body, he was completely unaffected in the five regional walls, other Gu Immortals, however, were restricted by the regional walls, no matter what Gu worms they used, they would have to face a backlash.\n\nWith this difference, Fang Yuan’s advantage was too huge, Heavenly Court did not want to see this situation.\n\nIn the past, they would not be affected by central restriction white-gold saint light qi, but now was different, with the merging of the five regions and the rampage of qi tides, the entire world’s aura has been unified, Gu Immortals were no longer differentiated by regions.\n\nAnd this new combined aura of the five regions was not any of the previous five regional qi.\n\nThus, no matter which region the Gu Immortal came from, they would be suppressed within this five restriction profound light qi.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nFang Yuan dealt a heavy blow to Divine Emperor City, causing this huge city’s green surface layer of light to shake and tremble.\n\nBut Divine Emperor City was too huge, even Fang Yuan could not destroy it for now.\n\nFrom Divine Emperor City, a female immortal flew out, she was a young lady with a beautiful appearance, it was Fairy Yu Xiu.\n\nShe surged with battle intent as she went to Fang Yuan: “Gu Yue Fang Yuan, do you dare to fight me?”\n\nAt this time, another Immortal Gu House arrived in Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space.\n\nIt was Longevity Heaven’s Calamity Luck Altar.\n\nBing Sai Chuan’s voice resounded from within: “Fang Yuan, why don’t we join hands and dismantle this Divine Emperor City first!”\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly and replied: “No, currently, Demon Judgment Board has been thrown into the five regional walls, while Divine Emperor City is too big and hard to send flying. Your side will stall Divine Emperor City while I will go and destroy Demon Judgment Board!”\n\n“Fang Yuan…” Bing Sai Chuan wanted to urge him.\n\nBut Fang Yuan turned around and went into the five colored smoke without hesitation.\n\n“Ignore him, our target is Divine Emperor City!” Within Calamity Luck Altar, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun sat at the main seat as he ordered.\n\n“Yes, master!” Bing Sai Chuan immediately moved Calamity Luck Altar, which crashed towards Divine Emperor City like a comet.\n\nFairy Yu Xiu gritted her teeth, she had to defend it.\n\nLu Wei Yin also arrived at this moment.\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan!” He only managed to see Fang Yuan’s figure disappearing into the five colored smoke.\n\n“Sigh!” Lu Wei Yin sighed deeply, he did not dare to enter the five colored smoke deeply, he had to communicate with Bing Sai Chuan and attack Divine Emperor City instead.\n\nThe five regional limit formation continued to function as five colored smoke poured out endlessly.\n\nWithin the dense smoke, Demon Judgment Board charged everywhere, trying to find the location of the formation. Outside the dense smoke, Divine Emperor City and Calamity Luck Altar fought intensely.\n\n“Found it!” Inside Demon Judgment Board, Fairy Ming Hao’s eyes suddenly opened.\n\nShe was a pseudo venerable level wisdom path great expert, her full strength was nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nBut this deduction also dealt heavy damage to her, after all, she was using wisdom path killer moves in the five regional walls.\n\n“Good, if we destroy this formation, we will be ruining one of Fang Yuan’s trump cards!” Gu Yue Fang Zheng flew with great morale, charging with Demon Judgment Board.\n\nThe five colored smoke became denser as Demon Judgment Board’s luster became dimmer, Gu Yue Fang Zheng was sustaining a huge backlash, his face soon turned pale as blood oozed out of his mouth.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nFang Yuan found them and used killer moves continuously with terrifying strength.\n\nDemon Judgment Board was facing greater difficulty in defending itself, it moved precariously ahead.\n\n“Ignore him, destroy the formation!” Fairy Ming Hao’s child-like appearance was filled with boldness and determination.\n\nDemon Judgment Board paused for a moment before shooting out a blood red beam of light.\n\nThe blood red light was thick and powerful, it landed on the formation with an extremely fast speed.\n\nThe surface of the five regional limit formation radiated with five colored lights, it shook slightly but did not collapse.\n\n“How can this be?” Within Demon Judgment Board, Fang Zheng was very shocked.\n\nHe was clear of this move’s power, even within the five regional walls, it should not be this weak.\n\nFairy Ming Hao understood the reason immediately, her pupils shrank slightly: “Fang Yuan invested a lot into this formation, it has at least eight rank eight Immortal Gu and the defense is high, we cannot destroy it in a short period of time!”\n\nThe five regional limit formation used Region and Limit as the cores originally, as well as a vast number of mortal Gu.\n\nAfterwards, Fang Yuan added earth vein Immortal Gu, followed by Formation Spirit and Formation Flag.\n\nDuring the fate war, these Immortal Gu were mostly rank seven.\n\nBut the current Fang Yuan was different, while recuperating, he did not just modify the five regional limit formation again by raising its defense, he even raised all of the Immortal Gu in this formation to rank eight.\n\nHis wealth was simply unimaginable!\n\nThe full powered attack of Demon Judgment Board could not even remove one layer of the five regional limit formation’s defense. In fact, because they activated a powerful killer move, the backlash was even greater.\n\nThis famous rank eight Immortal Gu House was now covered in cracks, it was near the point of breaking apart.\n\n“What should we do now?” Fang Zheng could not help but be flustered internally.\n\nFang Yuan was attacking outside and giving him huge pressure. Their goal of trying to destroy the five regional limit formation was also impossible now.\n\n“I advise that we retreat!” Fang Zheng gritted his teeth, suggesting to Fairy Ming Hao.\n\nFairy Ming Hao nodded: “Fighting here is too unfavorable. But it is fine, destroying this formation was only one attempt, even if we fail, there is no consequence on the eventual outcome. Let’s go!”\n\nFairy Ming Hao left Demon Judgment Board and opened her immortal aperture’s entrance, storing this Immortal Gu House.\n\nNext, in front of Fang Yuan’s surprised gaze, she vanished on the spot!\n\nSoon, Lu Wei Yin, who was fighting outside, transmitted to Fang Yuan that Fairy Ming Hao had suddenly appeared beside Fairy Yu Xiu, he also asked about the situation on Fang Yuan’s end.\n\n“The two pseudo venerables Ming Hao and Yu Xiu are able to teleport to each other instantly?” Fang Yuan guessed.\n\nFairy Ming Hao did not succeed in destroying his five regional limit formation, while Fang Yuan also failed to destroy Demon Judgment Board.\n\nIn essence, this was a draw, Fang Yuan might have a slight upper hand.\n\nBut the situation was still stuck in a deadlock.\n\n“As long as the five regional limit formation is still functioning, five colored smoke will continue to spread and fill the entire true inheritance space.”\n\n“But this will take too long, neither Heavenly Court nor Longevity Heaven will want to stay in here until then.”\n\nFang Yuan pondered rapidly.\n\nThe five regional limit formation was not a battlefield killer move, it could not restrain people, they could enter and exit freely.\n\nIt would take too long for the five colored smoke to fill Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space, during this period of time, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance might be discovered by someone, or the space might collapse because of the intense fights.\n\nFang Yuan flew out rapidly, leaving the five colored smoke, he went to the battlefield of Divine Emperor City and Calamity Luck Altar.\n\nOn one hand, he was wary of Heavenly Court’s deduction ability, similar to his refinement path attainment, Heavenly Court’s wisdom path attainment was a huge advantage for them. Fang Yuan had to restrain them from having the time to deduce the true inheritance’s location.\n\nOn the other hand, Fang Yuan had to join the battle and make deductions in his mind as well.\n\nDivine Emperor City floated in the sky while spreading green light, it was grand and imposing, remaining unmovable.\n\nCalamity Luck Altar was like a golden comet, Bing Sai Chuan manipulated it to its limit, it flew around Divine Emperor City continuously, launching all sorts of attacks.\n\nBetween the two Immortal Gu Houses, four pseudo venerables, Fang Yuan, Lu Wei Yin, Ming Hao, and Yu Xiu were fighting.\n\nThe two sides were first evenly matched, but soon, Fang Yuan and Lu Wei Yin fell into a disadvantage.\n\nFairy Ming Hao and Fairy Yu Xiu were very powerful, they each had a mature combat system.\n\nFairy Ming Hao’s flying stars seemed like a singular move but they were all consecutive moves. By repeatedly hitting the same target, Fang Yuan would have to endure increasing damage each time.\n\nFairy Yu Xiu’s methods were also very profound, she used her attainment level to suppress others. It was hard for ordinary Gu Immortals to find a countermeasure.\n\nLu Wei Yin fell into a tough battle due to Fairy Yu Xiu’s focus on him.\n\nWhile Fang Yuan also had a taste of the power of Fairy Ming Hao’s pride Gu.\n\nThoughts collided in Fang Yuan’s mind with great issues, many powerful and complex killer moves could not be used, the risks were too great.\n\nAnd most importantly, Ming Hao and Yu Xiu had incredibly well coordinated cooperation.\n\nTheir coordination was extraordinary, Fang Yuan had never seen anything like it before.\n\nBecause of this, while Fang Yuan and Lu Wei Yin worked together, they were suppressed by the two fairies.\n\n“The cooperation of Yu Xiu and Ming Hao has produced a qualitative change, if I fought alone, I would have lost already!” Lu Wei Yin had a solemn mood.\n\nThe opponents were working together impeccably, their cooperation was simply not humanly possible, they gave off a natural feeling, as if it was only reasonable for them to work together this perfectly.\n\nWhile Ming Hao and Yu Xiu fought against Fang Yuan and Lu Wei Yin, they even had time to help Divine Emperor City resist Calamity Luck Altar.\n\n“Fang Yuan, you want Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance?” Fairy Yu Xiu smiled: “Then you need to know that Giant Sun Immortal Venerable had once been here and damaged Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space, he took out a portion of the true inheritance by force. Thankfully, you are allies, you can ask for it.”\n\nFairy Yu Xiu easily tried to sow discord.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly as he said to Lu Wei Yin: “Go deal with Divine Emperor City, I will handle these two.”\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan, without me, if you fight alone…” Lu Wei Yin was hesitant.\n\nFang Yuan looked at him coldly: “Leave, you are hindering me.”\n\nLu Wei Yin gritted his teeth as he flew away from Fang Yuan.\n\nSeeing this change, Fairy Ming Hao and Yu Xiu saw the weakness in their enemies, they looked at each other before launching rapid attacks at Fang Yuan together.\n\nFang Yuan opened his immortal aperture’s entrance and let out a young Gu Immortal.\n\nRank eight transformation path Gu Immortal Zhan Bu Du!\n\nImmortal killer move — Incomplete Freedom Transformation!\n\nThe young man shouted as a blood red cape appeared on his back, fluttering with the wind.\n\n“I became handsome, I became stronger!” Zhan Bu Du clenched his fist, staring at the two female immortals with a shining gaze filled with surging fighting spirit."
