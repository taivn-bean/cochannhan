Since I cannot get it, neither will any of you.”\n\nImmortal killer move — Myriad Year Hunting!\n\nFragrance spread from Myriad Year Flying Warship, it quickly dispersed and caused countless dao beasts to resonate and growl.\n\nA wave of a year beast tide was rapidly forming.\n\nIn the previous life, Fang Yuan cooperated with Bing Sai Chuan and fought against Heavenly Court over this Red Lotus true inheritance, in the end, Feng Jiu Ge acted and destroyed the stone lotus island.\n\nThis time, Fang Yuan made the same choice, he used myriad year hunting to summon an endless beast tide that targeted the stone lotus island.\n\nThis method was Myriad Year Flying Warship’s strongest ability, it had an evident weakness however, the year beasts did not differentiate enemy from ally, in fact its main target was Myriad Year Flying Warship itself.\n\nLast time, Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals fell for Fang Yuan’s scheme, they thought that he could control the beast tide and slaughtered a large number of year beasts, taking most of the damage for Myriad Year Flying Warship. After suffering a loss, Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals realized that Fang Yuan could not control this beast tide either.\n\nThe weakness of myriad year hunting was already known to Heavenly Court.\n\nBut this time, Fang Yuan used it to target Heavenly Court’s weakness, they were setting up the river suppression lotus sealing formation now, they had no choice but to fight against these beasts.\n\nGu Liu Ru snorted coldly: “This scoundrel is very devious, he used this move after all.”\n\nHe had a calm expression as he instructed his people, Eternal Yacht and Shark Flow Lever left the battlefield immediately to head to the outside. At the same time, Nine Spiritual Fairy jumped out of her Immortal Gu House, turning into an immemorial desolate beast to leave the battlefield.\n\nHeavenly Court had the advantage while Fang Yuan’s Myriad Year Flying Warship was encircled, he could not stop these people from escaping.\n\nAfter leaving the battlefield, Eternal Yacht and Shark Flow Lever shined with a bright light, two auras resembling years flow like water Immortal Gu started to spread out.\n\nThe newly formed beast tide was instantly lured to these two Immortal Gu Houses as eighty percent of them rushed towards the two Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nThe remaining twenty percent were intercepted by Nine Spiritual Fairy who had turned into an immemorial desolate beast, she took control over them.\n\n“It’s her indeed!”\n\n“Nine Spiritual Fairy… a rank eight great expert that cultivated enslavement path and transformation path in Central Continent’s history.”\n\nWithin Myriad Year Flying Warship, a Gu Immortal had already discerned Nine Spiritual Fairy’s identity.\n\nRight now, Fang Yuan’s main body was in Eastern Sea, only his will was inside the ship, the will could think and make comparisons to his previous life’s events.\n\nNine Spiritual Fairy did not wake up in the previous life, but this time, she woke up and even earlier in time.\n\nThis was a very different situation.\n\nAfter she turned into the immemorial year beast, the River of Time was no longer an obstacle to her.\n\nEven though Heavenly Court could not counter myriad year hunting directly, they found ways to deal with it.\n\nThey analyzed the concept of myriad year hunting and targeted it, resolving the year beast tide that had yet to fully form.\n\nNext, even if year beasts emerge, there would only be a few of them, they would not be of a threatening scale.\n\nThis was Heavenly Court’s foundation.\n\nIt was also the reason why Fang Yuan had been concealing his strength and methods all along.\n\nOnce he exposes his methods, Heavenly Court would rapidly react and make deductions, they would counter his actions in their next encounter.\n\nThis was the case for daybreak sword, torrential charge, and myriad year hunting.\n\nMyriad year hunting, which could change the situation, was resolved by Heavenly Court before it even showed effect.\n\nThe remaining four Immortal Gu Houses surrounded Myriad Year Flying Warship tightly as they unleashed a barrage of attacks.\n\n“Fang Yuan, if you still have any methods left, use them.” Gu Liu Ru smiled coldly.\n\nWithin Myriad Year Flying Warship, Fang Yuan’s will was silent, he did not respond.\n\nThe battle continued, Myriad Year Flying Warship was kept suppressed and unable to turn it around. Even though it tried to break out several times, it did not succeed.\n\nOver at Heavenly Court’s four Immortal Gu Houses, Moment Stage was in front, as a rank eight Immortal Gu House and with the time path great expert Gu Liu Ru stationed in it, it was not inferior to Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nAt the same time, the other three Immortal Gu Houses worked together to assist it, their cooperation was not simple, they were very effective in their actions.\n\nEvidently, during this period of time, these Gu Immortals did not slack off, they had practised extensively and their battle strength rose greatly.\n\n“Fang Yuan is already trapped, he is not a threat.”\n\n“Be careful, we cannot be careless against this demon.”\n\n“Our river suppression lotus sealing formation is almost complete, what can Fang Yuan do to stop us?”\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals had a surge of morale.\n\nMany of them could already see the sight of Fang Yuan’s defeat.\n\nBut at this moment, a grand aura surged from the stone lotus island.\n\nGolden light flashed as a grey stone giant stood up slowly.\n\nThis giant was immensely tall, its muscles were bulging, its hair was thick, its eyes shined with a fierce beast light.\n\n“What monster is this? It has time path aura!”\n\n“We have not explored the stone lotus island yet, why did the guardian of this stone lotus island awaken?”\n\n“Oh no, the river suppression lotus sealing formation has not been completed yet.”\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals had changes of expression.\n\nThe giant roared, it was actually the sound of a tiger’s roar, the sound waves spread out in all directions, causing huge ripples to form around the island.\n\nThe river suppression lotus sealing formation shook intensely, the Gu Immortals setting up the formation spat out mouthfuls of blood.\n\n“Quick, stabilize the formation!”\n\n“Paper cage formation was broken, we need to repair it.”\n\n“Fourth group, Gu Immortals of the fourth group, quickly reinforce us!”\n\nThe Gu Immortals setting up the formation became very busy.\n\nAfter the grey stone giant roared, it moved its arms, the muscles on his forearm and upper arm expanded like a balloon, to three times of its original size.\n\nPitch-black bull horns grew on its forehead, it lowered its head slightly as its arms gathered in front of its chest, it opened its palms and placed them together, air currents surged and gathered between its palms, creating a spiral ball made of currents.\n\nGu Liu Ru saw this as shock appeared in his eyes.\n\nHe understood, these air currents were just the physical appearance, these were actually time path dao marks!\n\nMore and more time path dao marks were drawn by the giant and gathered into a huge silver ball.\n\nThe ball became larger and larger, the giant monster growled and pushed with both arms, throwing the silver ball with all its strength.\n\nThe silver ball flew like a meteor, shooting out and causing endless gusts of wind to blow.\n\nCentral Continent’s righteous path Gu Immortals were deeply shocked, their pupils shrunk when they saw this giant silver ball’s might.\n\n“Quick, we need to block it!” Gu Liu Ru gritted his teeth, he forcefully controlled Moment Stage to block the advancement of the silver ball.\n\nBoom!\n\nAt the next moment, an intense sound erupted, the silver ball crashed into Moment Stage and burst out with terrifying might, Moment Stage was like a house swept by a typhoon, it flew away even when resisting.\n\n“We blocked it.” Moment Stage stopped eventually as Gu Liu Ru let out a breath of turbid air, Moment Stage was already damaged beyond words, it was filled with cracks, countless mortal Gu died while many Immortal Gu were injured.\n\nThe Gu Immortals inside Moment Stage were already very busy, they could not stay as carefree as when they encircled Fang Yuan anymore, they quickly tried to repair the Immortal Gu House.\n\nThe aftermath of the silver ball explosion caused intense winds to blow, the river suppression lotus sealing formation was still affected and damaged, many Gu worms died, the Gu Immortals setting up the formation were very busy trying to fix it.\n\nSeeing that its attack did not work, the grey stone giant started to gather a silver ball again.\n\nGu Liu Ru saw this and gritted his teeth, he controlled Moment Stage to charge down.\n\nBut as Moment Stage got close to the stone lotus island, it gave off a brilliant light and a formless force blocked Moment Stage from approaching.\n\nUsing this time, the grey stone giant gathered another silver ball in its hands.\n\nThe ball shot out, Gu Liu Ru had no choice but to grit his teeth and resist the silver ball again using Moment Stage.\n\nBoom!\n\nAnother explosion resounded, after the intense impact, the front part of Moment Stage was completely devastated, a large number of tiles and bricks flew out and turned back into Gu worm corpses.\n\nThe grey stone giant saw that its method was obstructed once again, it became infuriated as it growled and gathered another silver ball.\n\nGu Liu Ru frowned deeply: “This giant is using a very familiar time path method! To think that Red Lotus Demon Venerable had left this behind.”\n\n“But even if I know about its information, for now I can only block its attack by sacrificing Moment Stage, I need to protect this river suppression lotus sealing formation! Thankfully, we have this Moment Stage.”\n\nGu Liu Ru felt glad in his heart.\n\nThe signature method of Moment Stage was to teleport from one location to another location in a moment’s time.\n\nThis was not a space path method but a time path method instead, it was not teleportation in essence, but was the act of using Moment Stage to compress its time into a moment. If the distance was further, it would take several moments.\n\nGu Liu Ru wanted to protect the formation, he had a clear objective. As long as the formation was set up, it would isolate this place from the outside, the stone lotus island would not be able to escape, all of Red Lotus’ arrangements on this island would weaken slowly and be resisted.\n\nAnd against outside force, there would also be a strong layer of protection.\n\nBy then, even if Fang Yuan wanted to enter, with this formation and several Immortal Gu Houses around, it would be difficult.\n\nFang Yuan evidently understood this logic, Myriad Year Flying Warship tried to move in different directions, the remaining Immortal Gu Houses were just rank seven, they could barely contain it. This was like a thin fishing net trying to capture a shark.\n\nHeavenly Court’s situation was getting worse, Gu Liu Ru snorted coldly and came out of Moment Stage, joining the encirclement of Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nHe was a time path great expert, he could move and act freely in the River of Time, with his interference, Heavenly Court stabilized the situation once again.\n\n“Persevere, persevere and we will gain victory!”\n\n“After this period, when the formation is completed, it would be Fang Yuan’s time to die.”\n\nGu Liu Ru took charge of the situation, he dealt with Myriad Year Flying Warship while raising the morale of his people.\n\nEventually, the river suppression lotus sealing formation was completely set up, it formed a huge sphere that not only surrounded the stone lotus island, but also Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nThe formation activated, the grey stone giant grunted as it felt a strong suppression.\n\nMyriad year hunting was also restricted, the fragrance could not spread out, a beast tide was unable to form.\n\n“Get rid of Fang Yuan first, then explore the stone lotus island!” Gu Liu Ru shouted.\n\nWithout the threat of myriad year hunting, Eternal Yacht, Shark Flow Lever, and Nine Spiritual Fairy returned in time, they joined the encirclement against Fang Yuan.\n\n“Fang Yuan, this will be your final resting place!” Gu Liu Ru’s eyes shined with bright light, he had a cold expression.\n\n“Is a demonic overlord going to die here?” Feng Jiu Ge squinted, inspiration regarding destiny song emerged in his heart.\n\n“Let’s not wait any longer, kill him!” Xing Ye Wang moved Shark Flow Lever and assaulted with deep killing intent.\n\nNine Spiritual Fairy was silent but her movements were not slow, she got around to the back of Myriad Year Flying Warship as her aura burst out, she prepared her killer move.\n\nBut at this moment, Fang Yuan’s cold snicker resounded in Myriad Year Flying Warship: “Oh Heavenly Court, you have already been trapped, can’t you sense it?”\n\nBefore he finished his words, stone lotus island erupted with a bright light, tens of water pillars shot up around the island.\n\nThe light and water pillars forcefully connected into the river suppression lotus sealing formation, the Central Continent Gu Immortals who were inside became dumbfounded. Someone shouted: “What is going on! We lost our control of this formation!!”\n\nThis was not a simple change of events.\n\nHeavenly Court’s four rank eights were in deep disbelief but the facts were in front of them: This was all Fang Yuan’s trap!\n\n“I did not waste a stone lotus island to trap you after all, this is not the place I will die, it is yours.” Fang Yuan said so as the grey stone giant on the stone lotus island grew chicken wings and feathers, its hands turned into tiger claws, its mouth turned into a beak, it flew up and barged past the encirclement, paving a way for Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nRealization flashed in Gu Liu Ru, he finally understood what this grey stone giant was, he shouted in shock and anger: “This is the Twelve Zodiac battle formation! To think that Fang Yuan had this method.”\n\n“This was all Fang Yuan’s trap!”\n\n“He has already obtained Red Lotus’ true inheritance, he can control the stone lotus island!”\n\n“This Twelve Zodiac battle formation is likely the content of the true inheritance, his time path foundation grew immensely, he is able to suppress our formation instead.”\n\n“We cannot stay here, we need to retreat!”\n\nThe four Heavenly Court rank eights discussed and decided to leave.\n\nBut the awkward thing was, this river suppression lotus sealing formation that they set up with so much work was their biggest obstacle at this moment.\n\n“Want to leave now? Too late!” Fang Yuan’s laughter could be heard inside Myriad Year Flying Warship, daybreak swords flew out and shot towards Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform and Shark Flow Lever.\n\nThe grey stone giant growled loudly and pounced at Present and Past Pavilion.\n\nPresent and Past Pavilion had torrential waves around it but the grey stone giant ignored that, it advanced and slammed down with its fist.\n\nThe grey stone giant was just too big, its fist was larger than Present and Past Pavilion itself.\n\nBefore the fist landed, sounds of tiger and dragon roars resounded in the battlefield.\n\nThe might of the fist was simply destructive and unrestrained!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge squinted while the other Gu Immortals were fearful, against this fist, they felt like the world was collapsing, any attempts to dodge it was futile.\n\nThey could not dodge!\n\nBoom!!\n\nAn intense explosion resounded as Present and Past Pavilion crumbled at the impact of the grey stone giant’s fist.\n\nThe injuries and deaths inside were severe, Feng Jiu Ge barely managed to escape in a sorry state.\n\nMoment Stage!\n\nAt the crucial moment, Moment Stage teleported over and took in Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nThe grey stone giant completely ignored the Moment Stage that was nearby, it turned around towards Sun and Moon Temple.\n\nSun and Moon Temple was a time path Immortal Gu House of Spirit Affinity House, it was weaker than the rest, when the grey stone giant approached, Sun and Moon Temple could not escape in time.\n\nThe giant was too fast, it was inside the River of Time and had the power of the stone lotus island boosting it, its current battle strength was simply unheard of!\n\nBoom!!\n\nWith a second explosion, Sun and Moon Temple shattered, most of the Gu Immortals inside died.\n\n“No!!” Gu Liu Ru gritted his teeth, his eyes were red from anger, his body was shaking from hatred.\n\nThe Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were no longer as confident as before, they wanted to escape for their lives now.\n\nThe grey stone giant’s battle strength made them feel deep despair!\n\nEastern Sea, above qi sea.\n\nThe Gu Immortals were very excited as they looked at Qi Sea Ancestor and the owner of the black soul sea area, Zhang Yin.\n\nZhang Yin was a lone cultivator with rank eight cultivation level, everyone knew him in Eastern Sea’s Gu Immortal world.\n\nBut they did not expect that he would challenge Qi Sea Ancestor. Although thinking about it, it was not strange, back then, the fight between Duke Long and Qi Sea Ancestor was only witnessed by Song Qi Yuan and Shen Cong Sheng, and these two were righteous path Gu Immortals.\n\nUnder everyone’s gaze, Qi Sea Ancestor smiled lightly: “Gu Immortal Zhang Yin, you are very courageous, but will you be able to handle one move from me?”\n\nZhang Yin smiled arrogantly: “Ancestor, you underestimate me, not just one move…. ugh.”\n\nHe suddenly stopped as the other Gu Immortals’ expressions changed.\n\nInstantly, they felt the entire world buzzing as countless qi currents gathered from all over the place.\n\nWithin all the surroundings, pressure intensified.\n\nThe immortals’ pupils shrunk, cold sweat flowed down as they felt unparalleled pressure, they were like insects trapped in amber, fragile and helpless.\n\n“What killer move is this?”\n\n“Is this Qi Sea Ancestor’s method?”\n\n“We are merely feeling the side effect, what pressure is Zhang Yin, who is bearing the brunt of the attack, feeling?”\n\nThe immortals looked over, Zhang Yin’s face turned red, he did not move in the air, his eyes were bulging as he struggled, he only trembled as he could not break free.\n\nThe immortals were all shaken.\n\nA loud sound could be heard from above their heads.\n\nThe Eastern Sea immortals quickly looked up and all of their faces turned pale as paper.\n\nA huge hand completely made of qi currents was translucent and pale-white, it extended an enormous distance, shrouding the skies itself!\n\nThe giant hand pressed down as all of the Eastern Sea immortals felt suffocated, it was as if a mountain was crashing down upon them.\n\n“What sort of power is this!”\n\n“If I were not here personally, I would never believe it.”\n\n“I’m afraid this strength is on par with rank nine?”\n\n“Qi Sea Ancestor!!”\n\nAt the banquet, many Gu Immortals stood up uncontrollably, their bodies shook as fear overwhelmed them.\n\nZhang Yin shouted with all his strength, his entire body was radiating dark energy as mild lightning flashed weakly, he could not escape, he was trapped and fixed in the air.\n\nSeeing this, Song Qi Yuan and the other rank eight Gu Immortals were all incredibly shocked and fearful.\n\n“It looks like Zhang Yin has used his full strength, but he cannot escape at all?”\n\n“Is he going to die?!”\n\n“Qi Sea Ancestor’s battle strength is so terrifying. Does he wants to leave a deep impression on us and use Zhang Yin’s life to raise his reputation in Eastern Sea?”\n\nIt was unimaginable, a rank eight Gu Immortal was completely helpless against Qi Sea Ancestor!\n\nBut the truth was right here, Song Qi Yuan and the other Eastern Sea Gu Immortals had to believe it.\n\nAs the qi current hand approached Zhang Yin, it slowly disintegrated and went past Zhang Yin, slamming into qi sea.\n\nThere was no heaven shaking explosion, after the qi current hand came into contact with qi sea, it quickly scattered and fused into the sea.\n\nZhang Yin regained freedom, he felt deep lingering fear as his clothes were filled with sweat, he had a fearful look as he stared with wide eyes, breathing roughly.\n\n“Look at qi sea!” Song Yi Shi shouted.\n\nEveryone turned to look, the treacherous and turbulent qi sea filled with countless spirals had been completely calmed, it was like a mirror now!\n\nEastern Sea’s immortals were very shocked, many of them opened their mouths but could not speak.\n\n“Ancestor’s divine might, I have fully experienced it.” Zhang Yin let out a breath of air as he paid his respects: “Thank you for sparing me.”\n\nQi Sea Ancestor was still sitting at the main seat, his eyes were barely open as he waved his sleeves lightly: “Take a seat.”\n\n“Thank you.” Zhang Yin took his seat amidst the silence.\n\nMany of the Eastern Sea immortals were still standing, those who were seated were not feeling any better, they were all like statues.\n\nQi Sea Ancestor defeated Zhang Yin in one move, he had truly intimidated all of them.\n\n“Ancestor has divine might!” After a while, Song Qi Yuan reacted as he stood up, respectfully praising.\n\n“Ancestor has divine might!” Shen Cong Sheng also stood up and praised with respect.\n\n“Ancestor has divine might. Ancestor has divine might.” Countless Eastern Sea Gu Immortals stood up to pay their respects, they were completely in awe.\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly as he said: “Everyone, take a seat, the banquet is beginning.”"
