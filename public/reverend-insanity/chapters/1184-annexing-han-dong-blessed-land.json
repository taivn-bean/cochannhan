And inside the jade pools, the water was different and bred countless aquatic species.\n\nBut the water here was connected to the same source. Because there were crevices between the rocks that formed the terrain of the beach.\n\nFang Yuan looked, there were large numbers of fish and prawns, all sorts of aquatic insects and mortal Gu. Under the beach, in the crevices, there were seashells, mussels, seaweed, and others.\n\nBut what was most abundant was a type of snake.\n\nThis snake was pinkish red in color, it was small and delicate, about the size of an adult’s thumb, smaller ones were only a few centimeters.\n\nThis was a spirit snake.\n\nGu Immortal Han Dong specialized the most in this transformation.\n\nThis was Han Dong’s blessed land.\n\nHan Dong was one of the Traveling Three Elites, back then when Dong Fang Chang Fan possessed Dong Fang Yu Liang and tried to revive, he had used the immemorial ruin bat corpse to create a temporary base.\n\nBy the time Fang Yuan and the rest got there, Gu Immortal Han Dong from the Traveling Three Elites had already died here.\n\nThe Traveling Three Elites were Lu Qing Ming, Su Guang and Han Dong.\n\nThey were lone cultivators, rather famous ones.\n\nWhen the three worked together, they could use an immortal killer move that gathered light, forming a chariot that could travel quickly.\n\nIn the Gu Immortal world, when some Gu Immortals develop close relationships, they would help each other and cultivate together. As time passes, when they become more familiar, if they were talented, they would comprehend and create new joint immortal killer moves.\n\nThe Traveling Three Elites were like this, the wind thunder roar of Chou Lao Wu and Hao Zhen was similar.\n\nAmong the three of them, Lu Qing Ming was a wind path Gu Immortal, his signature move was entangled wind, it was very powerful and maneuverable.\n\nSu Guang was a light path Gu Immortal, while Han Dong cultivated transformation path!\n\nHe was a transformation path rank six Gu Immortal, this Han Dong blessed land was a rank six blessed land.\n\nFang Yuan floated in the sky, at this time, a pinkish red spirit snake slithered over towards Fang Yuan.\n\n“Hiss hiss hiss!”\n\nThe spirit snake was translucent without scales, its flesh was pinkish, it did not have bones, just one red line held its body from head to tail together.\n\nIt hissed at Fang Yuan, showing animosity in its tone.\n\nThis was different from the other snakes.\n\nFang Yuan could understand it, as the hissing turned into words in his ears: “Who are you? Why did you invade my home? Quickly leave, you are not welcomed here!”\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly: “I came here because I want to be your master, what are the conditions for that?”\n\n“Hiss hiss hiss!”\n\nThe pinkish red spirit snake hissed unhappily.\n\nFang Yuan nodded, feeling overjoyed, he thought to himself: “So Han Dong’s obsession before death has to do with Lu Qing Ming and Su Guang.”\n\nIt turned out that Han Dong blessed land’s condition was very simple yet strict.\n\nThe spirit snake in front of Fang Yuan was the blessed land’s land spirit, created after Han Dong’s death, fusing his obsession with heavenly power.\n\nThis land spirit would only acknowledge Lu Qing Ming or Su Guang.\n\nWhen either of them arrived, this blessed land would belong to them.\n\nFrom this point, the Traveling Three Elites truly had a close relationship. Han Dong’s obsession before dying was to leave all of his assets to his two good friends.\n\n“In that case, I will bring Lu Qing Ming here. We are good friends.” Fang Yuan spouted nonsense.\n\n“Hiss hiss hiss!”\n\nSpirit snake asked: “Is that true? You can find Lu Qing Ming? That is wonderful.”\n\n“In fact, he is nearby. Because your main body died here, Lu Qing Ming and Su Guang have been thinking about it. But Tai Qiu is too dangerous, thus, they asked me for help, and we finally found you after so long.” Fang Yuan started his chain of lies, he neither was flustered nor did his heart beat faster.\n\nThe spirit snake slithered around, moving its body, it was very excited.\n\nNext, it made an agreement with Fang Yuan, in just a few minutes, Lu Qing Ming would arrive.\n\n“Thank you, truly, you are a good person!” The spirit snake’s attitude changed, it was very welcoming as it opened the entrance, sending Fang Yuan out.\n\n“You must find Lu Qing Ming!” Seeing Fang Yuan off, the spirit snake closed the entrance longingly.\n\nFang Yuan flew in a circuit outside, storing away the upper extreme heavenly eagle and using familiar face to become Lu Qing Ming.\n\nHe came back and waited for a while, before the blessed land’s entrance opened.\n\n“Lord Lu Qing Ming… sob sob sob.” The spirit snake was at the entrance, seeing ‘Lu Qing Ming’, it started to sob uncontrollably.\n\nFang Yuan consoled it as the spirit snake’s mood lifted.\n\nThe spirit snake asked: “Lord Lu Qing Ming, where is your friend from earlier? He is a nice person, he actually brought you here.”\n\n“He is a kind and helpful person, he is very dependable. He has already left, he said that there is no point in staying here, he has already done his part.” Fang Yuan continued with his fairy tales.\n\nThe pitiful land spirit could not see through familiar face, it thought he was speaking the truth, immediately acknowledging Lu Qing Ming as its master.\n\n“Hiss hiss hiss!”\n\nThe spirit snake coiled around Fang Yuan’s shoulder: “From now on, you are the owner of this blessed land.”\n\nFang Yuan immediately changed his tone: “Wonderful, I’ve thought about it, I will give this blessed land to that friend of mine from earlier.”\n\n“Hiss?!”\n\nThe spirit snake was stunned.\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly: “Since I am the owner of this place, I have the authority for that, right?”\n\n“Hiss… hiss.”\n\nThe pinkish red spirit snake lowered its head, it was upset but it still responded, acknowledging Fang Yuan’s words.\n\nFang Yuan immediately left, in a moment, he got rid of familiar face and returned in his original appearance.\n\nVery successfully, the spirit snake acknowledged him as master.\n\n“Hiss hiss hiss!”\n\nThe spirit snake said: “From today onwards, you are the owner of this blessed land. Sigh, even though I am sad, this is Lord Lu Qing Ming’s wish.”\n\nNext, there were even more saddening words coming out of Fang Yuan’s mouth: “Since you acknowledge me as your master, work with me, assimilate this blessed land into my own blessed land.”\n\n“Hiss? Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss hiss!”\n\nThe spirit snake was completely stunned, before becoming frantic: “What? Why must we do that? If we do that, I will disappear!”\n\n“Of course I know that. But by fusing into my blessed land, I can skip multiple calamities and tribulations, it is helpful to me.” Fang Yuan continued.\n\nThe pinkish red spirit snake thought of something and cried out: “To annex my blessed land, you need to be at least a transformation path master.”\n\n“I primarily cultivate transformation path, I am a grandmaster!” Fang Yuan replied mockingly.\n\nThe spirit snake lost all its vigor, its head was lowered to the ground: “Fine, you are the owner of the blessed land, you can do whatever you want, I will cooperate.”\n\nImmortal apertures could annex one another.\n\nThere were many restrictions and requirements in this.\n\nFirstly, a smaller immortal aperture could not engulf a bigger one.\n\nSecondly, dead apertures could not devour others.\n\nFinally, annexing immortal apertures required specific attainment levels. To annex a rank six blessed land, one needed to have master attainment level in that path. For rank seven blessed lands, one needed grandmaster attainment level. and for rank eight grotto-heavens, one needed great grandmaster attainment level!\n\nOnce these requirements were met, another person’s immortal aperture could be devoured and become part of one’s own immortal aperture!\n\nThere were many benefits in this.\n\nFirstly, the resources inside the annexed immortal aperture would be completely transferred into the other immortal aperture without any need for relocation.\n\nSecondly, one would gain a portion of its dao marks.\n\nThirdly, and the most crucial point, the skipping of calamities and tribulations!\n\nFor example, Hu Immortal, an enslavement path lone cultivator from Central Continent, had died during her fifth earthly calamity, from the blue charm lightning shadow. Even though the blue charm lightning shadow remained, the fifth earthly calamity of Hu Immortal blessed land was passed.\n\nIf a Gu Immortal annexed this blessed land, they would gain all of the resources inside Hu Immortal blessed land, at the same time, they would receive a portion of the blessed land’s dao marks, and they would skip at least one calamity or tribulation, to a maximum of five. Furthermore, the countdown towards their next calamity or tribulation would be reset.\n\nSouthern Border, Jade Pot Mountain.\n\nYing Wu Xie’s group arrived at the interior of the mountain.\n\n“To think that Jade Pot Mountain has jade soil on the surface, producing beautiful jade that is renowned in Southern Border, but the interior is actually an icy land, it is truly another world here.” Bai Ning Bing stood inside the icy cave, sighing in shock.\n\nAs they got deeper into Jade Pot Mountain, the temperature lowered, frost energy emanated, even though the Gu Immortals had defensive methods, they still felt a strong chill assaulting them.\n\nYing Wu Xie suddenly paused his steps, he seemed to have sensed something, he spoke while looking forward at the empty space: “We are here. This is a rank six immortal aperture left behind by a strength path Gu Immortal of Shadow Sect.”\n\nNext, Ying Wu Xie turned around and said to Hei Lou Lan: “Hei Lou Lan, this is for you. You have enough strength path attainment level, you can annex this immortal aperture. This way, your upcoming calamities and tribulations will be bypassed.”\n\nHei Lou Lan’s expression changed.\n\nShe had the Great Strength True Martial Physique, one of the ten extremes, her calamities and tribulations were immensely powerful.\n\nAnnexing an immortal aperture could resolve her problem, but it sacrificed her potential for growth in the future, only to obtain some short term benefits.\n\nShe hesitated, but eventually gritted her teeth, walking forward.\n\nYing Wu Xie internally nodded at this, he understood Hei Lou Lan’s feelings, he spoke: “In a Gu Immortal’s cultivation journey, pursuing potential and long term growth is not wise. If you cannot survive the upcoming tribulation, then there is no future to speak of. Don’t worry, this blessed land contains strength path dao marks that are not fewer in number than your ten extreme physique tribulation. Shadow Sect’s cultivation methods are not something you can imagine. But how much you can actually absorb is up to your own fortune. Because the annexing of others’ immortal apertures will often result in a reduction of dao marks gained to some extent. It is far less than stuffing a Gu Immortal’s corpse into your immortal aperture directly and allowing it to break down naturally.”\n\nHei Lou Lan’s body shook, the anticipation in her gaze became heavier.\n\nYing Wu Xie could not help but think of Fang Yuan, he added in his mind: “Of course, the sovereign immortal body is exempt from this.”"
