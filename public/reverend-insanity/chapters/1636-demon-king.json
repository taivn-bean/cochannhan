There was a huge plaque above the gate, writing the words ‘Five Xiang’s Bet Entrance’.\n\nThe entire gatehouse seemed to be made of bronze, it radiated a majestic aura. Initially, it was only a phantom image, but as time passed, it became solid and clearer.\n\nQi clan had six Gu Immortals in total, they were all standing outside the gatehouse now, waiting for it to materialize entirely.\n\n_1_\n\nThe leader was an old Gu Immortal, he had a thin body but strong spirits, his eyes radiated with brilliance, he stood up straight like a spear. He was Qi clan’s first supreme elder Qi Fa.\n\nOn his left was Qi clan’s second supreme elder Qi Cai, he stroked his beard as he said: “I have experienced many openings of the seal, but this time, I feel very impatient, I almost cannot wait!”\n\nThird supreme elder Qi Jin laughed: “This bet has been going on for thousands of years, we are finally going to end it today. As descendants of Qi clan, we can proudly face our ancestors, we are the eventual victors of this bet!”\n\nAs they spoke, the gatehouse formed fully, a huge area of clouds gathered to hold up this gatehouse.\n\nThe door started to shine in five colors, representing the strength of the Five Xiangs.\n\nFirst, red light shined down, causing the clouds to turn bright red.\n\nThis was Xue Xiang’s Xue clan, because they cultivated blood path, they had been wiped out. Thus, after the red light shined around the place, it faded away.\n\nNext was yellow light.\n\nIt was Chi Xiang’s Chi clan, even though they had descendants, because they lived in the immortal apertures of their ancestors and did not work hard, they were living like livestock, not a single Gu Immortal emerged from among them.\n\nNext, a brown light appeared.\n\nNi Xiang’s Ni clan had Gu Immortals in the past, even though the numbers were small, they were all elites. Especially Ni Er, someone deduced that his refinement path attainment level was at the point of quasi-supreme grandmaster! He was the one who fused Immortal Gu into the bloodline of Ni clan members, he wanted to assist his descendants but right now, Ni clan’s villages were controlled by Qi clan, they could not win.\n\n_1_\n\nAfter the brown light came white light.\n\n“Our turn.” Qi Cai became very alert, he could not wait anymore.\n\n“Let’s go.” Qi Fa said with a firm tone, he led the four Gu Immortals behind him as they went to the gatehouse, bathing in the white light.\n\nThe white light flickered for a moment as it got stronger, sweeping around the five Qi clan Gu Immortals’ bodies as it returned to its original intensity, continuing to shine.\n\n_1_\n\nBut Qi clan’s Gu Immortals were all here already.\n\nWithout any additional descendant of Qi Xiang, the white light faded away.\n\nThere was a white light spiraling above the heads of the five Qi clan Gu Immortals, they had passed the test of the Five Xiang’s seal, they were qualified to enter for the bet.\n\n“Bai clan is the last one.” Qi Jin spoke, unable to conceal his nervousness.\n\nQi clan’s Gu Immortals were all above the clouds, they had not entered the door yet, they were alert and looked around.\n\nThey knew of the existence of Bai Ning Bing.\n\nBai Ning Bing had inherited Bai Xiang grotto-heaven, she even learned the immortal killer move Bai Xiang, displaying great power in a few battles.\n\nHeavenly Court had exposed intel on Fang Yuan, that involved the Shadow Sect members as well. Even though Bai Ning Bing was not part of Shadow Sect, her information was also exposed.\n\nEven though Qi clan was secluded and did not mix with the circles of Gu Immortals, they still had their collection of information regarding the outside world.\n\nBlue light shined for a while but nobody showed up, it was about to weaken and fade away.\n\nQi Cai let out a breath of air: “Good, Bai Ning Bing did not show up. Our Qi Cai will definitely win…. hmm!”\n\nHe had just spoken when two figures approached at a rapid speed, in the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of the gatehouse.\n\nQi clan’s Gu Immortals looked over and saw a boy and a girl.\n\nThe girl had silvery hair that flowed down to her waist. Her pale blue dragon eyes emitting a cold aura to the outside world. Her skin was white as snow, her expression was cold, her beauty was simply divine. And the most eye-catching thing was the pair of small coral-like dragon horns on her forehead.\n\nSeeing this female immortal, Qi clan’s Gu Immortals all thought of a name — Bai Ning Bing.\n\n“Bai Ning Bing came after all, damn it!”\n\n“Who is that beside her?”\n\nQi Jin first noticed Bai Ning Bing before turning his gaze towards the other Gu Immortal.\n\nThis Gu Immortal was a young man with similarly long hair that was black and smooth, he had a sharp and tall nose, his face was extremely exquisite, his eyes were deep like the abyss, resembling the darkness that existed since the beginning of time, able to devour anything in its way.\n\nSeeing this young looking Gu Immortal, Qi Jin shook like he had been hit by lightning, his heart turned cold, he gulped as he said in a hoarse voice with great difficulty: “Fang, Fang Yuan…”\n\nHe was already the most composed one, the Qi clan Gu Immortals around him were shaking, their legs were trembling as they had sweat pouring down their foreheads.\n\nBai Ning Bing was Fang Yuan’s henchman, the five regions’ Gu Immortals knew that.\n\nIf Bai Ning Bing appeared and participated in the Five Xiang’s bet, Fang Yuan was likely to come too.\n\nQi clan had known this and were mentally prepared for it before coming here.\n\nHowever!\n\nWhen Fang Yuan truly appeared in front of them, they found that their mental preparations were all in vain. Fear, panic, chaos, all sorts of emotions filled their hearts, they felt like they had fallen into an icy river.\n\nThis was Fang Yuan!\n\nHe had been reborn using Spring Autumn Cicada.\n\nRefining an Immortal Gu on Three Kings Mountain as a mortal, snatching Hu Immortal blessed land from the Central Continent ten great ancient sects.\n\nHe went to Northern Plains and destroyed Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, nobody knew how great his gains were.\n\nHe inherited a true inheritance of Thieving Heaven and cooperated with Lang Ya blessed land and the other variant humans, becoming a traitor of humans.\n\nHe disguised as Wu Yi Hai and deceived Wu Yong like a fool.\n\nDuring the dream realm battle, he toyed with the entire righteous path of Southern Border and became the leader of Shadow Sect.\n\nSouthern Border’s righteous path chased after him and Heavenly Court hunted him, but he remained free and got stronger and stronger.\n\nAt the regional wall, he fought against the rank eight Gu Immortal Thunder Ghost True Monarch as a rank seven and pummeled her, leading to a fall in Heavenly Court’s reputation.\n\nWhen Lang Ya blessed land was invaded by Heavenly Court, he stole Fixed Immortal Travel and left freely!\n\nSeveral months ago, he ambushed Southern Border’s righteous path and kidnapped many Southern Border Gu Immortals, extorting all the super forces.\n\nNot long ago, Heavenly Court had distributed the intel in treasure yellow heaven, the battle in the River of Time had been exposed. The entire world of the five regions was shocked! Fang Yuan had become a rank eight Gu Immortal silently, obtaining killer moves like spring scissors, summer fan, and five finger fist heart sword, most amazingly, he even had the long lost method, time cutting edge.\n\nSeeing that his intel was exposed, Fang Yuan returned the favor and exposed all of Heavenly Court’s methods as well.\n\nThe Gu Immortal world was in a huge commotion!\n\nHeavenly Court’s foundation and methods were shocking.\n\nBut the scarier thing was, Fang Yuan managed to escape regardless.\n\nHeavenly Court had set up a super time path formation in the River of Time, there were multiple rank eights and many Immortal Gu Houses, but they could not do anything to Fang Yuan!\n\nEven though Fang Yuan lost, in fact running away like a dog, after this battle was exposed, his reputation soared and left a deep impression in everyone’s hearts.\n\nNot only because of his schemes and ferocity, but also due to his opponent being Heavenly Court.\n\nIt was created since the Remote Antiquity Era, Heavenly Court which had three million years of history and had withstood the multiple invasions of various Demon Venerables, the number one human force created since the beginning of human history!\n\nAfter so long, this Heavenly Court could actually do nothing to a demonic path Gu Immortal?!\n\n_1_\n\nThis was a really rarely seen situation.\n\nEven throughout the entire history of Heavenly Court, it was rarely seen.\n\nCountless Gu Immortals and super forces were watching, waiting to see how Heavenly Court would capture Fang Yuan. How long could Fang Yuan really last?\n\nBecause of all these emotions, Fang Yuan’s reputation was at its peak.\n\nRank seven Fang Yuan could resist rank eight.\n\nRank eight Fang Yuan was the king of demonic immortals, shaking the world!\n\n_1_\n\nHe had grown like a shooting star, the speed was simply unthinkable. This meteor was currently like the blazing sun, he was bright and dazzling, countless people could not even look up at him.\n\nDemon King Fang Yuan!\n\n_1_\n\nQi clan’s Gu Immortals started trembling even more fiercely, Fang Yuan’s mere entrance had already intimidated all these people.\n\nHis demonic might was unstoppable."
