But to these desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts, the ten great fierce areas were their sanctuaries, they were places where humans could not take over.\n\nSeeing so many desolate beasts charging over at once, the Gu Immortals were apprehensive.\n\nAlthough there was a good number of them, they were not united, instead, they were wary of each other due to the wisdom path inheritance, it was hard to work together sincerely.\n\nThey could not battle with the desolate beasts either.\n\nOnce they fought, the chaotic battle would cause damage to Tai Qiu, if they destroy the traces left behind by the teleportation Gu formation, the Gu Immortals would have even greater trouble tracking them.\n\nThose who could become Gu Immortals were not fools.\n\nDong Fang Chang Fan’s plot was very obvious, they all understood it clearly in an instant.\n\n“These desolate beasts and even ancient desolate beasts are not the point.”\n\n“We cannot spend too much time with these beasts and lose our clues.”\n\n“Get past them and find the traces, following the clues to the inheritance ground…”\n\nThe Gu Immortals were still flying towards the area where the teleportation Gu formation was, but they had to slow down.\n\nDesolate beasts were a huge problem, but the surrounding Gu Immortals were worse. If it was convenient, these demonic path Gu Immortals would certainly not mind exterminating some of the competitors around them.\n\nHowl! A desolate beast flying at high speed engaged with a female Gu Immortal.\n\nThis rank six female Gu Immortal’s name was He Ruo, also known as Peacock Flying Immortal, she was skilled in transformation path. She shouted a curse, she felt sullen inside, but she could not blame anyone, she could only blame herself for being unlucky and placed in a bad position.\n\nSeeing that the desolate beast was charging over, she did not fight it, she turned into a blurry green-grey bird, spreading her wings and flying away, towards the crucial location.\n\nThe desolate beast was unable to catch up to her, it turned around and targeted another unlucky person.\n\nThe green-grey bird flew past the other Gu Immortals, becoming the Gu Immortal closest to the crucial location.\n\nOther Gu Immortals did not watch this without doing anything.\n\n“A mere mortal killer move, you dare to stand out?” Waves were crashing as a rank seven Gu Immortal rode on a huge wave and blocked the green-grey bird.\n\nThis Gu Immortal had a strong aura, but he was so thin his bones could be seen, his skin was wrinkled and dry, sticking close to his bones. Veins could be seen on his skin, they were everywhere.\n\nSeeing this person, most of the surrounding Gu Immortals showed a wary expression on their faces.\n\nThis was a rank seven Gu Immortal, Pi Shui Han, he was a member of the demonic path and cultivated ice path and water path, he was a famous expert.\n\nPeacock Flying Immortal He Ruo saw that Pi Shui Han was obstructing her, she did not evade him, instead, she snorted lightly and an Immortal Gu aura burst out from her.\n\nHe Ruo activated her Immortal Gu, the green-grey bird she had transformed into turned from blurry to clear.\n\nIn an instant, the green bird’s body expanded by thirty percent, three golden peacock tails grew on her back, her speed rose sharply as she flew past the waves, towards the Gu formation.\n\nPi Shui Han’s actions failed, he laughed instead of getting angry, saying in a mocking tone: “Indeed after attending the Northern Plains auction, you think you have some ability now, hehe.”\n\nSaying this, he raised both his arms.\n\nGurgle gurgle, with two loud sounds, the water waves surged up, emerging from nowhere, blocking the green bird like two huge walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Pi Shui Han’s speed did not decrease, he rode on the currents and charged towards He Ruo.\n\nHe Ruo did not dare to fight with Pi Shui Han, she raised her head and spread her wings, rising into the sky. But no matter how high she flew, the waves grew alongside her.\n\nPi Shui Han smiled coldly, he rapidly got close to her.\n\nBut He Ruo did not want to battle, she put all her efforts into escaping, Pi Shui Han could do nothing to her within a short period of time.\n\nJust as the two were fighting, one figure emerged from another side, like a flash of lightning.\n\nThis person was brawny and muscular, his skin was bronze in color, lightning was coiling around his body, his speed was faster than He Ruo. Fang Yuan felt some familiarity upon seeing him saw, he thought over it for a moment and realized that this person was Divine Lord Tian Du.\n\nThis immortal cultivated lightning path, he alongside Shi Hou had once coerced an immortal zombie of Zombie Alliance, buying a hundred and fifty kilograms of wilted essence with one immortal essence stone.\n\nDivine Lord Tian Du saw Pi Shui Han and He Ruo chasing and fleeing, he found a chance and activated his movement killer move, gaining a huge boost in speed.\n\nSoon, he surpassed everyone and quickly became the person closest to the Gu formation.\n\n“Hahaha!” Divine Lord Tian Du saw that he was getting closer to the Gu formation and was overjoyed, laughing loudly.\n\n“Divine Lord, hold up.” Accompanying a calm and slow voice, one white robed scholar appeared before Tian Du.\n\n“Ah, Unfettered Scholar!” Divine Lord Tian Du saw this person and his expression changed, his speed fell drastically.\n\nHe knew that he was not the rank seven Gu Immortal, Unfettered Scholar’s match, he shouted quickly: “Shi Hou, quickly lend me a hand.”\n\nShi Hou’s eyes twitched, he had no choice but to show up beside Divine Lord Tian Du. He was a muscular man, looking very rugged and brutish, his hair was in a mess and he held a skull in his hands.\n\nDivine Lord Tian Du cried out, pushing with his hands as a lightning dragon was unleashed.\n\nAt the same time, Shi Hou activated his mortal killer move, attacking Unfettered Scholar.\n\nThe two were not weak in battle strength among rank six Gu Immortals, otherwise, they would not dare to extort a Zombie Alliance member. At this moment, they joined forces and had an impressive attack, it attracted much attention.\n\n“Come then.” Unfettered Scholar smiled lightly, he moved his hand as two Immortal Gu flew out.\n\nBoom!\n\nIn an intense explosion, Shi Hou and Divine Lord Tian Du flew back after spitting blood, but Unfettered Scholar stood on the spot, having a calm demeanor.\n\nHe was fighting two against one, beating back Shi Hou and Divine Lord Tian Du, the Immortal Gu he used had great power, but they were already placed back inside his immortal aperture, nobody had seen them clearly.\n\n“Let’s go!” At this moment, from another direction, Gu Immortal Lu Qing Ming shouted, as the Gu Immortals Su Guang and Han Dong followed after him.\n\nTheir advance caused gasps among the crowd.\n\n“It is the Traveling Three Elites!”\n\n“Block them!”\n\n“Be careful, when they join forces, their battle strength can match rank seven.”\n\nThe three elites gave off bright lights each, it was a dazzling scene, forming an image of a chariot. This was a killer move that could only be unleashed when all three Gu Immortals worked together!\n\nThe killer move had great power, the three elites could charge forward fearlessly, nobody could stop them for the moment, they got close to the Gu formation.\n\nThere were five publicly well known rank eight Gu Immortals in Northern Plains. There were more rank seven Gu Immortals, but they were not in large numbers. People like Qin Bai Sheng, Fairy Li Shan, and others, they were famous people who had been around for a long time.\n\nIn the Gu Immortal world, most Gu Immortals were rank six.\n\nWhen the three elites joined up, they had rank seven battle strength, this made people wary. Furthermore, they had chosen their specific direction and had no strong foes of rank seven. Whether it was by coincidence or not, the three of them managed to become the ones closest to the Gu formation.\n\nThey were extremely fast, Pi Shui Han, Unfettered Scholar and the others could not stop them, they could only watch as the three elites landed on the Gu formation that was set up earlier.\n\nHowever, a change occurred right at this moment!\n\nThe figures of the three elites vanished, while a huge bat desolate beast flapped its wings and flew away.\n\n“This is a ruin bat!”\n\n“Ruin bat is a space path desolate beast, there were actually concealment type Gu on this beast, the three elites were engulfed by it.”\n\n“Hahaha, although they are not in mortal danger, they lost precious time and the valuable opportunity.”\n\nSome Gu Immortals were shocked, some were taking pleasure from their misfortune.\n\nRuin bat was not an exception, at this moment, the desolate beasts in Tai Qiu had surrounded the Gu Immortals, ready for a huge battle.\n\nThe peach wolf, which was pink, cute and had a tiny body, moved extremely quickly like light, the white hoof ink horse was stalwart like a mountain, the blood tongue tree had bloody and long tongues. And also, the qi path ancient desolate beast, primeval return peacock, that could absorb the primeval energy of a huge surrounding area, three desolate beast coiling mountain goats, and a lawless antelope that could give even a rank seven Gu Immortal a headache.\n\nThe scene became chaotic at once, desolate beasts and Gu Immortals fought in intense battles, while the Gu Immortals were wary of each other. But no matter how chaotic it was, the Gu Immortals were protecting one crucial location, they tried to preserve all traces of the teleportation Gu formation.\n\n“Follow me.” With Fairy Li Shan at the lead, Fang Yuan and Hei Lou Lan were in the chaotic battle, fighting carefully and moving around agilely, they stealthily had gotten close to the Gu formation.\n\nGrr!\n\nA bull shaped desolate beast blocked Fang Yuan and the other’s path.\n\n“You dare rob me?!” Gu Immortal Zhuo Zhan carried a huge hammer and wore a red bronze suit of armor, he rode on a fat boar as he charged towards Fang Yuan and the others.\n\nAt the same time, Divine Lord Tian Du, who was far away laughed coldly, an Immortal Gu flew out, turning into lightning as it shot over, it was known as Thunder Shuttle.\n\nHei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan were about to strike, when Fang Yuan stopped them: “Please don’t worry, let me use my method.”\n\nAs he said this, countless Gu worms flew up in his immortal aperture.\n\nRank four all-out effort Gu, bitter strength Gu, borrow strength Gu, self-reliance Gu, refine essence spirit Gu, earth strength Gu, water strength Gu, wind strength Gu, lightning strength Gu, fire strength Gu, lurking soul coat Gu, breath concealment Gu…\n\nCountless mortal Gu flew up like butterflies, circling around one spot.\n\nAn Immortal Gu was proudly at the center, it was the strength path Immortal Gu — Self Strength!\n\nFrom the mesmerizing flying, the mortal Gu created traces of light in the air. Self strength Immortal Gu burst out with a blinding light, connecting all of the traces of light into one, forming a light lump resembling a small sun.\n\nThe light shined on the ground in the immortal aperture.\n\nOn the ground, there were hundreds of thousands of Fang Yuan’s strength path phantoms standing and waiting silently!\n\nBefore coming here, Fang Yuan made his preparations, he summon his strength path phantom army prior to this trip.\n\n“Immortal killer move, Myriad Self — First Style — Giant Hand!” Fang Yuan mentally called out.\n\nTens of thousands of phantoms of Fang Yuan stretched out their right hands, raising them up high, palms facing the huge light lump in the sky.\n\nAround the light lump, there were a hundred group strength Gu entering it.\n\nAt the same time, Fang Yuan in the outside world stretched out his right hand.\n\nBoom—!\n\nA strength path giant hand appeared out of nowhere.\n\nThe air within dozens of meters around him was pulled.\n\nThe giant hand pushed, the bull shaped desolate beast was pushed away and into the air.\n\nThe giant hand gripped, thunder shuttle Immortal Gu was trapped inside.\n\nThe giant hand closed into a fist, it punched at Gu Immortal Zhuo Zhan.\n\nZhuo Zhan was stunned, his eyes were wide open and staring, after shouting in shock, he escaped in panic!"
