Soon, Fang Yuan manipulated the strength path immortal zombie to come out of the snow unscathed.\n\nBut his expression was quite dark.\n\n“Even if I use self will and get rid of heaven’s will, the result would be that the snow monster self-detonates, it cannot be subdued?”\n\n“But even if I could subdue it, I spent hundreds of self will Gu to cleanse just one snow monster’s head, the cost is too high.”\n\nSelf will Gu was only a mortal Gu, but it was rank five.\n\nFurthermore, the self will Gu was not refined by Fang Yuan, he had asked the hairy man Gu Immortals to refine by paying contribution points. Because of this, the cost was higher to Fang Yuan.\n\nAnd most crucially, it costed his time.\n\nFang Yuan had to injure a desolate beast snow monster, forcing it to be unable to move or resist him, before he could flood it with self will and get rid of the heaven’s will.\n\nOne desolate beast snow monster might not take long, but Fang Yuan had so many snow monsters in Mini Northern Plains.\n\nWith a greater number, the time needed would increase, his second earthly calamity was coming, Fang Yuan could not do this.\n\n“Actually, even if I enslave the desolate beast snow monsters and sell them, it is dangerous.”\n\n“Back then, one of the first split souls of Shadow Sect, the Gu Immortal named Green, had researched the life-and-death immortal aperture in Earth Trench’s super Gu formation. A huge explosion occurred during his research, countless immortal materials were infested with heaven’s will, Green avoided them like the plague. Because of that, he threw these immortal materials away. This firm attitude of his shows a huge problem.”\n\n“If I truly sell these snow monsters filled with heaven’s will, there might be horrible series of consequences.”\n\nAfter his attempt failed, Fang Yuan could only continue his previous plan to kill these snow monsters.\n\nHe had to kill these snow monsters completely before the second earthly calamity. He even had to cleanse all of the heaven’s will here, not a trace could be left.\n\nOrdinary snow monsters were cannon fodder, Fang Yuan could easily kill them, it was not a problem.\n\nBut desolate beast snow monsters were harder to deal with, he had to spend some time. As for ancient snow monsters, they were even more troublesome.\n\nFang Yuan started to miss flying sword Immortal Gu.\n\nWith flying sword Immortal Gu as the core, the immortal killer move sword marks targeting death was extremely effectively in dealing with ancient snow monsters. Triple layered sword wave was an attack with wide range, it was too wasteful to use against a single ancient snow monster.\n\nAnd using triple layered sword wave had a huge cost.\n\nThankfully, Fang Yuan regained his strength path Immortal Gu, he could use the killer move myriad self once again.\n\nStrength path had few requirements for primeval essence and immortal essence, myriad self first style, giant hand required much less immortal essence to activate than triple layered sword wave.\n\nIn the following period of time, Fang Yuan used his strength path giant hands to eliminate these ancient snow monsters and desolate beast snow monsters.\n\nHe first used beast enslavement Immortal Gu to try and enslave a snow monster.\n\nAfter failing, the snow monster would be angered and fall into a frenzied state, pursing Fang Yuan endlessly.\n\nFang Yuan immediately retreated, luring this snow monster away, before using strength path giant hands to kill them.\n\nThis way, the other snow monsters would not be alerted.\n\nEarlier, when Fang Yuan attacked, the snow monsters would gather into groups, but now was different, the efficiency was higher.\n\nAfter enslavement path methods failed, the target would feel great hatred towards the Gu Master. Fang Yuan made full use of this.\n\nEarlier, Fang Yuan had tried other methods, but mortal enslavement path methods were too weak, and some wisdom path methods were useless due to heaven’s will.\n\nThus, the beast enslavement Immortal Gu that Fang Yuan borrowed was not useless after all.\n\nDays passed, less than thirty percent of the snow monsters were left. But there was less than ten days until the second earthly calamity.\n\nFang Yuan manipulated the strength path immortal zombie, coming to Mini Southern Border in the immortal aperture.\n\nAt a particular location, Fang Yuan’s original immortal zombie body was placed.\n\n“Even though I have my original immortal zombie body, I can only look at it, I cannot use it.” Fang Yuan sighed, mobilizing self will Gu as he placed his formation.\n\nAfter some time, a Gu formation using hundreds of self will Gu as the core was created.\n\nThis Gu formation was mainly for sealing.\n\nFang Yuan obtained the method of setting up this formation from Shadow Sect.\n\nUsing a large number of self will Gu to seal heaven’s will.\n\nThe super Gu formations that Shadow Sect had in all five regions used this method.\n\nAfter inspecting it, and confirming there were no problems, Fang Yuan let out a sigh.\n\nFang Yuan’s immortal zombie body was at the center of the Gu formation, the Gu formation had completely sealed the Spring Autumn Cicada inside.\n\nSpring Autumn Cicada had originally been sealed by one of Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals, Wei Ling Yang. Ying Wu Xie was unable to activate Spring Autumn Cicada and start again. Thus, he was trapped in Central Continent and could only trade with Fang Yuan.\n\nDuring the transactions, Ying Wu Xie returned Fang Yuan’s immortal zombie body as well as Spring Autumn Cicada.\n\nAfter obtaining it, Fang Yuan realized that Spring Autumn Cicada was still sealed, it could not even consume the water of the River of Time. It was weakening, on the verge of dying.\n\nFang Yuan had tried many methods but this seal was very powerful, he could not even obtain any information about it. Without other options, he could only give up on this.\n\nNot long ago, the method of the rank eight restriction path Gu Immortal, Wei Ling Yang, seemed to have worn out. Spring Autumn Cicada’s seal was lifted, Fang Yuan knew that heaven’s will was hidden inside it, only refinement path methods could remove it.\n\nFang Yuan did not dare to place this immortal zombie body outside. Storing it inside his own immortal aperture was safest.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was afraid that during the second earthly calamity, the heaven’s will inside Spring Autumn Cicada would coordinate with the calamity. Thus, he set up this Gu formation, sealing heaven’s will and preventing this threat from occurring.\n\nThree more days passed, the snow monsters were completely eliminated from Fang Yuan’s immortal aperture.\n\nNext, he used self will to cleanse all of the heaven’s will.\n\nFor this, Fang Yuan paid a huge price. Even though giant hand had a low cost, using it so many times meant his consumption was still very high.\n\nRight now, Fang Yuan did not have much immortal essence or immortal essence stones.\n\nBecause treasure yellow heaven closed, even though Fang Yuan had a lot of resources, he could not sell them. His Lang Ya Sect contribution points were also dwindling.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan could earn more from teaching the hairy man Gu Immortals combat techniques, Lang Ya land spirit was making his own plans, he reduced the rewards of these missions while raising the reward of the falling star hound mission.\n\n“Treasure yellow heaven… treasure yellow heaven… when are you going to open?”\n\nFang Yuan waited for the opening of treasure yellow heaven as he prepared for his second tribulation.\n\nThere were five days until his second earthly calamity, Fang Yuan cleansed all of the heaven’s will inside, before going to Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nUsing myriad self and other methods, he completely altered the appearance of Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nNext, using pulling mountain Immortal Gu, he moved Dang Hun Mountain into his sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nEarlier, Fang Yuan did not have Landscape as Before, he did not dare to do this, but now his worry was lessened greatly.\n\nSuch a commotion caused Lang Ya land spirit to show up.\n\nHe asked nervously: “Elder Fang Yuan, what are you doing?”\n\nHe was worried, because Dang Hun Mountain belonged to Fang Yuan, it was not like Luo Po Valley. If Fang Yuan wanted to bring it away, he could not stop him.\n\nFang Yuan had a glib tongue, he gave an excuse of his that was prepared long ago, saying he was going to leave Lang Ya blessed land for some time.\n\nLang Ya land spirit believed what he said, he wanted Fang Yuan to exterminate the falling star hound, but instead, he was going to leave with Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nLang Ya land spirit was very worried.\n\nFang Yuan used this chance to exchange all of his sect contribution points, he even used wisdom Gu as collateral to borrow a lot of Immortal Gu from Lang Ya land spirit, and large amounts of immortal essence stones.\n\nHe finally replenished his green grape immortal essence!\n\nRegretfully, up until Fang Yuan left Lang Ya blessed land, treasure yellow heaven did not open.\n\nFang Yuan sighed, choosing to move a portion of the resources in his immortal aperture to Lang Ya blessed land for safekeeping.\n\n“So much resources? It seems that you are very skilled in managing an immortal aperture.” Lang Ya land spirit was a bit surprised at the amount of resources Fang Yuan had.\n\nBut in fact, this was only a small portion, it was not even thirty percent.\n\nFang Yuan was not going to move out all of his resources, Lang Ya land spirit was not a fool, he would be suspicious of Fang Yuan’s sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nWith half a day until the earthly calamity descended, Fang Yuan used the transportation Gu formation to go to the northern icy plain.\n\nEven though the northern icy plain was created by Reckless Savage Demon Venerable, and had lots of Reckless Savage’s true meaning, heaven’s will still existed here.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan did not come here far in advance.\n\nThe icy plain was huge, Fang Yuan casually chose a direction and picked a spot to place his immortal aperture.\n\nWhat would the second earthly calamity be?\n\nNo matter what it was, the second earthly calamity’s might would surely be greater than the first.\n\nFang Yuan waited for it vigilantly!"
