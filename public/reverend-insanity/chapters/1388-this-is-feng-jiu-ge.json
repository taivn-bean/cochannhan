  "content": "Chapter 1388: This is Feng Jiu Ge!\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nA middle-aged Gu Immortal appeared in front of Fang Yuan and Wu Yong.\n\nThis person was dressed in a red and white robe, standing straight like a spear or sword. His eyebrows were sharp like swords, mysterious light was flashing in his eyes, a gentle smile was on his face, and there was an elegant and invincible aura in him.\n\nBut at this moment, his expression carried a trace of melancholy.\n\nHe was a Central Continent Gu Immortal whose name was spread throughout the five regions, a pillar of Spirit Affinity House, a sound path rank seven who could battle rank eight, he was Feng Jiu Ge!\n\nWhy was he here?\n\nWu Yong and Fang Yuan were surprised and astonished.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s appearance and achievements had long spread throughout the five regions. Thus, although Wu Yong was seeing Feng Jiu Ge for the first time, he quickly recognized him.\n\nAfter all, a rank seven Gu Immortal who could fight rank eight was a peerless genius that was rarely seen even once in a thousand years!\n\nWere it not for Fang Yuan’s other identity, Liu Guan Yi, Feng Jiu Ge would probably still be the only one to hold this achievement.\n\nWu Yong quickly restrained his surprise and sneered at Feng Jiu Ge: “A Central Continent Gu Immortal actually dares to appear in front of me. Good, good!”\n\nIn the battle of the dream realm, Heavenly Court reaped the most benefits, taking away many Immortal Gu from Southern Border’s righteous path.\n\nRight now, Feng Jiu Ge was being implicated by this matter and provoked Wu Yong’s hostility.\n\nFang Yuan’s gaze also focused on Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nThis was not his first time seeing Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nIn his first life of five hundred years, Feng Jiu Ge’s appearance had already been imprinted in the depths of his heart. The radiance Feng Jiu Ge emitted in the five regions chaotic war had even surpassed ordinary rank eight Gu Immortals. Unfortunately, he died in Lang Ya blessed land.\n\nHis death had led to a great disturbance, shaking Central Continent while the other four regions danced in joy.\n\nEven after being reborn, Fang Yuan had seen Feng Jiu Ge as well.\n\nIt was in that strange space inside the Thieving Heaven true inheritance in Luo Po Valley. Under some strange combination of coincidences, Fang Yuan had saved Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nOriginally, he would have perished inside the Thieving Heaven true inheritance’s strange space because of Qin Bai Sheng’s suicidal attack. But it all changed after Fang Yuan’s rebirth.\n\nAlthough Fang Yuan had done it completely unintentionally, he was indeed Feng Jiu Ge’s savior.\n\nBut so what if he saved Feng Jiu Ge’s life?\n\nIn this world, how many times had kindness been reciprocated with ingratitude?\n\nFang Yuan fixed his gaze on Feng Jiu Ge, he did not dare to relax as he shouted coldly: “Feng Jiu Ge, you are the person Heavenly Court arranged to ambush me?”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge glanced at Wu Yong before fixing his gaze at Fang Yuan.\n\nSeeing Fang Yuan again, moreover in such a situation, made Feng Jiu Ge sigh inwardly.\n\nFang Yuan’s progress was too fast!\n\nThe first time Feng Jiu Ge knew of Fang Yuan, the latter had seized Feng Jin Huang’s opportunity and became the new owner of Hu Immortal blessed land.\n\nBecause of his daughter, Feng Jiu Ge knew of Fang Yuan’s name.\n\nBut he was not even in the least bit concerned.\n\nThe reason?\n\nBecause back then, Fang Yuan was only a mere mortal. The difference between an immortal and a mortal was like the difference between heaven and earth, the difference between cloud and mud, they were not even at the same level. It could even be said to be the mortal Fang Yuan’s greatest glory for being able to attract a trace of attention from the grand Gu Immortal Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nHowever, the development of later events went far beyond Feng Jiu Ge’s expectations.\n\nFang Yuan continued to be involved in major events, repeatedly bringing calamity to the world. His identity was exposed, an otherworldly demon who was the owner of Spring Autumn Cicada, inheritor of Giant Sun’s true inheritance and so on, the whole world was shocked. Especially when Fang Yuan’s progress was extremely fast, he rapidly ascended from a mortal to an immortal, and then to an expert among Gu Immortals, everything happened in a flash.\n\nMany Gu Immortals could not have such accomplishments even after putting in effort for countless years.\n\nBut Fang Yuan seemed to have easily achieved this.\n\nThe first time they truly met, Feng Jiu Ge was actually saved by Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan smoothly inherited one of the Thieving Heaven true inheritances – ghostly concealment, then in the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain, Fang Yuan played a huge role.\n\n“I did not expect Liu Guan Yi to be Fang Yuan. The great era is coming, heroes and experts are emerging, and Fang Yuan is currently the one who is shining the brightest.” Feng Jiu Ge sized up Fang Yuan while thinking to himself.\n\nAt the same time, he had a wry smile on his face: “I hurried over from Central Continent to pursue an Immortal Gu that Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable had once used, but unintentionally ran into this matter.”\n\n“Is he saying he is not the person arranged by Heavenly Court?” Fang Yuan frowned.\n\nBased on Feng Jiu Ge’s nature and way of doing things, he would not deceive Fang Yuan at such a juncture.\n\nWu Yong, however, sneered in disbelief: “Who could have thought Feng Jiu Ge to have a hypocritical side as well. When I activated the battlefield killer move, you could have easily left if you did not want to participate in this matter.”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge nodded: “Right. I entered of my own accord, it is because I owe my life to Fang Yuan. It would not matter if I had not come across this, but since I ran across this matter, I have to help him.”\n\n“What?” Wu Yong was astonished.\n\nFang Yuan was also dumbstruck.\n\nWu Yong asked back in an incredulous tone: “I didn’t hear wrongly? You owe him your life, so you want to help him? Hahaha.”\n\nWu Yong started laughing.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was a Central Continent Gu Immortal, a person from the ten great ancient sects, everyone believed he would definitely become a member of Heavenly Court in the future.\n\nHe was actually going to save Fang Yuan?\n\nWho was Fang Yuan? An otherworldly demon, a demon listed at the top of the Demon Judgment Board.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge actually wanted to save him?\n\nThis was simply a huge joke.\n\nWu Yong laughed, but not only him, even the smile on Feng Jiu Ge’s lips started becoming bigger.\n\nAs Wu Yong looked at Feng Jiu Ge’s smile, his laughter gradually stopped, slowly replaced by solemness.\n\nHe knew.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was serious!\n\nThis person was simply a lunatic!\n\nA righteous path Gu Immortal wanted to help a demon.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was not just an ordinary righteous path Gu Immortal, he was a huge star of the righteous path, despite having only rank seven cultivation, he was treated as a quasi-rank eight expert by the world. His reputation in Central Continent and in the five regions was extremely huge.\n\nAnd Fang Yuan was similarly not an ordinary demonic character. Over these last years, he held the biggest spotlight in the whole world! He was a complete otherworldly demon, possessing Spring Autumn Cicada, Reverse Flow River… Giant Sun’s true inheritance, Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance… In Central Continent, he had seized Hu Immortal blessed land under the noses of the ten great ancient sects. In Northern Plains, he had destroyed Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, he then went to Southern Border and thwarted Spectral Soul’s heaven-defying plan, and seized the fruits of victory. And recently, he had successfully infiltrated Wu clan, and after the battle of the dream realm, he became the leader of Shadow Sect!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge wanted to help a person like Fang Yuan?\n\nWu Yong was a righteous path Gu Immortal, he tried putting himself in Feng Jiu Ge’s shoes, even if Fang Yuan saved his life, how much pressure would he face if he helped Fang Yuan?!\n\nThis pressure did not only come from his faction, it came from his family, his sect, Heavenly Court and even all the Gu Immortals in the world.\n\n“No! Feng Jiu Ge is different from me. He is not born of the righteous path, and was once a demonic path Gu Immortal.” Wu Yong suddenly recalled.\n\n“Demons are truly insane, they cannot be reasoned with!” Wu Yong raged inwardly.\n\nFang Yuan thought of Feng Jiu Ge’s past.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had been an unremarkable secluded cultivator with no fame in his early years.\n\nHe cultivated sound path and committed to it his entire life.\n\nOne time, he sang loudly in a nameless valley, which attracted two other Gu Immortals to sing in chorus.\n\nBack then, it was night time with the moon hanging high and light wind blowing gently, causing ripples in a glittering lake in the valley.\n\nAs the three Gu Immortals sang in harmony, time flew by rapidly, and they had sung till dawn.\n\nThe three stopped singing and started laughing. They did not greet each other, but left full of joy.\n\nOnly after a few years did Feng Jiu Ge learn of these two’s names and origins. At that time, there was news in Central Continent’s Gu Immortal world that these two were demonic Gu Immortals who had seized a rank seven Immortal Gu from Black Heaven Temple, and were hunted down by the allied forces of the ten great ancient sects.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge immediately set off to help them.\n\nThose two Gu Immortals were at a dead end, opposed by the masses, so when they saw Feng Jiu Ge coming to aid them, they were both moved and surprised, asking Feng Jiu Ge why he did this.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had replied: “A few years back, we sang together, I sang about the bright moon, while you sang about the verdant mountain and a white lake. The clear moon and gentle breeze showed your human hearts. How could those capable of singing such a song be petty people who covet others’ Immortal Gu? I trust you two.”\n\nThe two were so touched their tears started flowing down.\n\nOne of them spoke: “You… understand us. We had inherited this rank seven Immortal Gu from a true inheritance, but how could we have imagined Black Heaven Temple to falsely accuse us. Black Heaven Temple is one of the ten great ancient sects, whatever it says, others believe them.”\n\nThe other persuaded Feng Jiu Ge: “We have only sang one song together, we are complete strangers. The two of us are in great danger and have no hope left. It is still not too late for you to leave.”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge, however, shook his head and insisted on helping them.\n\nThe two immortals said worriedly: “If you do not leave, you will also be branded as a demon.”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge laughed: “Neither demonic nor righteous, there is only Feng Jiu Ge in this world. To leave or to stay, I decide my own life and death.”\n\nThe two immortals were moved, and teared up in admiration.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s poems were not famous back then. But as he repeatedly forced back Black Heaven Temple’s Gu Immortals and was victorious time and again, the matter soon got out of hand.\n\nWhen the other nine ancient sects heard of the matter, they expressed support for Black Heaven Temple and created the huge pressure of public opinion.\n\nAs a result, Feng Jiu Ge proclaimed that he would challenge Central Continent’s champions as he traveled the world.\n\nThe ten sects sent their experts to challenge Feng Jiu Ge in single battles, but were all defeated.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was not afraid, fighting as he continuously traveled a huge distance, suddenly changing his tactic and going for the enemy headquarters, causing the ten sects to lose miserably. The scene was total chaos and there was nothing anyone could do.\n\nFinally, Spirit Affinity House made their move, the fairy of that generation, Fairy Bai Qing, moved Feng Jiu Ge with love and turned him into a member of Spirit Affinity House.\n\nBack then, Feng Jiu Ge could put himself on the line to save two complete strangers who had only sung a song with him, becoming labeled as a demon as a result.\n\nNow, why would Feng Jiu Ge not help the demon Fang Yuan?\n\nEspecially when Fang Yuan had saved his life!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was still the same person be it in the past or present.\n\nFang Yuan suddenly realized the meaning behind Feng Jiu Ge’s earlier sigh.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had already wanted to help Fang Yuan, but he thought of his wife and daughter as well as his situation. He was probably intending to help secretly.\n\nBut unfortunately, his presence was sensed by Wu Yong.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had to make a choice after that.\n\nAnd just like what he did back then.\n\nHe made a similar choice.\n\nNeither demonic nor righteous, there is only Feng Jiu Ge in this world.\n\nTo leave or to stay, I decide my own life and death.\n\nDemonic path or righteous path, these two factions and identities could not restrain Feng Jiu Ge!\n\nTo leave or to stay, as far as Feng Jiu Ge was concerned, if he left, his heart would not be free, only by remaining would his heart be at ease.\n\nHis actions simply came from his inner heart.\n\nI am always me.\n\nI am Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFor all eternity!"
