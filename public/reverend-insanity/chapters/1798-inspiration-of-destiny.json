And now, these resources were distributed ingeniously and harmoniously to form a balanced ecology.\n\nThere was no chaos or mutual disturbance, the resources aided one another in their growth.\n\nThis was the result of Fang Yuan’s meticulous deductions using wisdom path.\n\nThe next step was to fill up some gaps.\n\nFor instance, white steel bowl valley was something Tie Qu Zhong wanted to construct but had not started yet. With it, Tie Qu Zhong could feed edge Gu by himself and would not have to rely on external sources.\n\nFang Yuan had already filled the gaps here.\n\nIn the previous life, he had completed this project, and it was even easier in this life.\n\nAs for the necessary resources, Fang Yuan extorted them from Southern Border’s righteous path.\n\nFang Yuan clearly felt it was much easier to extort the Southern Border righteous path in this life than in the previous life.\n\nIt was because the resistance of Southern Border’s Gu Immortals resistance had become much weaker.\n\nThe video Fang Yuan revealed in Heavenly Court showed him killing Chen Yi and Thunder Ghost True Monarch, this greatly stirred up the Southern Border righteous path!\n\n“Even Heavenly Court lost to this demon Fang Yuan, what is so strange about our Southern Border righteous path failing to deal with him?”\n\nEven if the Southern Border Gu Immortals did not admit this thought, they knew it inwardly.\n\nAdding on Fang Yuan’s plentiful experience in extortion, these Southern Border righteous path forces could only give in.\n\nThe extortion in this life was also different from the previous life.\n\nIn the previous life, Fang Yuan mainly wanted to construct a year essence pool and thus extorted many precious and rare immortal materials. He did not need to do so in this life and changed the demands to other things, but they were still mainly immortal materials.\n\nA small portion of these immortal materials were used to fill up the deficiencies in the sovereign immortal aperture, like constructing white steel bowl valley.\n\nThe remaining large portion was in preparation for advancing the ranks of his Immortal Gu.\n\nIn this life, Fang Yuan had a lot more Immortal Gu than in his previous life!\n\nRank six Immortal Gu occupied the majority but they were too weak for him, being at rank eight.\n\nSo large scale refinement was necessary and would give rise to a great increase in Fang Yuan’s comprehensive battle strength.\n\nHe had done this in his previous life, and it would be much easier in this life since he had annexed Lang Ya blessed land and had many refinement path Immortal Gu.\n\nHe planned ahead, preparing these immortal materials in advance.\n\nThe gains from annexing apertures were almost processed completely. The whole sovereign immortal aperture’s development had already reached sixteen percent, this was already close to the highest limit he reached in his previous life.\n\nMoreover, he still had Liu Hao’s and Ba Shi Ba’s immortal apertures to annex, as well as Beast Calamity grotto-heaven.\n\nKiller moves were being familiarized, true inheritances were still being researched, and he was still comprehending human path.\n\nFang Yuan made some time to go to the River of Time once again.\n\nHe was unable to forget about his pure dream clone.\n\nAlthough the plan for the pure dream clone had received a setback, Fang Yuan thought of the stone lotus island’s future self killer move.\n\n“Maybe I can use future self to bring over a Gu Immortal level pure dream clone!”\n\nThe Four Xunzi in Present and Past Pavilion were observing the River of Time at all times, but they were simply unable to detect Fang Yuan’s tracks.\n\nFang Yuan understood Present and Past Pavilion much more than them.\n\nHe smoothly reached the stone lotus island and used future self on the pure dream clone.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan was disappointed as there were simply no changes in the pure dream clone!\n\n“Is it because the pure dream clone is created from dream realms, most killer moves are ineffective on it?”\n\n“Or is it that the pure dream clone doesn’t have a future where it becomes an immortal?”\n\nFang Yuan’s pure dream clone was already at rank five peak stage, just a step away from undergoing immortal ascension.\n\nHowever, this step had fatal danger so Fang Yuan wisely chose to stop.\n\n“If future self is ineffective because the pure dream clone doesn’t have a future where it is an immortal, does this mean there is no hope for the pure dream clone’s tribulation with my current strength?”\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan suddenly felt somewhat interested.\n\n“There is no harm in trying.”\n\nHe immediately activated the immortal killer move exposing heavenly secret.\n\nThis killer move used heavenly secret Immortal Gu as its core and could observe the contents of the following calamities and tribulations of the target.\n\nBlank.\n\nExposing heavenly secret showed no effect on the pure dream clone.\n\n“Is it because of the characteristics of the pure dream clone, or because exposing heavenly secret is currently unable to target dream path calamities and tribulations?”\n\nFang Yuan was perturbed.\n\nThere were very few Gu worms that were effective on the pure dream clone.\n\nRelic Gu was effective because it was a human path Gu worm. The Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique body was a human body so human path Gu worms were effective on it.\n\nBut in fact, many other Gu worms were completely ineffective on the pure dream clone.\n\nBecause the pure dream clone was created from dream realms and had the characteristics of dream realms.\n\nFang Yuan had relied on dream path’s superiority to cross many obstacles before or stir up troubles, but he was now stumped by this superiority.\n\nJust like Heaven Overseeing Tower Lord, Duke Long and others were unable to contest lead soul into dream, even Spectral Soul had fallen asleep inside the dream realm, existing methods had negligible effect against dream realms.\n\nFang Yuan actually had many methods to deal with calamities and tribulations.\n\nFor instance, calamity beckoning Immortal Gu or endless trouble killer move, but could these methods be able to deal with dream path calamities and tribulations?\n\nFang Yuan shook his head in his mind, there was almost no chance!\n\n“The only possibility is to develop a corresponding dream path killer move.”\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan’s dream path attainment level was stuck. In the five hundred years of his previous life, he had not prioritized researching dream path and had pursued blood path.\n\nNot long after returning from the River of Time, Fang Yuan was pleasantly surprised as the dragonman clone plan had made a progress.\n\nXia clan expressed that Shang clan’s treasure realm had raging wave rising dragon fire, and they were currently in the process of trading for it.\n\n“Shang clan’s treasure realm… it should be the immortal aperture left behind by Shang clan’s creator.”\n\n“After the ancestor died, it was left behind in Shang Liang Mountain. Since Gu Immortals are unable to enter it, even Shang clan Gu Immortals don’t know if it is a grotto-heaven or a blessed land.”\n\n“Looks like the foundation of this treasure realm is much deeper than I estimated.”\n\nFang Yuan exclaimed at Shang clan’s foundation.\n\nShang clan had always been among the top few clans in the Southern Border Gu Immortal world, and because of their unique geographical location, they had maintained harmonious relationships with other super forces.\n\n“If Xia clan can get the raging wave rising dragon fire, my dragonman clone will have half of the obstacles remaining.”\n\nFang Yuan waited patiently while increasing his strength.\n\nWith regards to using five restriction profound light qi, he was gaining more experience and insight, and was now able to use four different light qi at the same time.\n\nHis soul cultivation was rising explosively every time. He had split his soul again for the dragonman clone, but even so, his soul cultivation was gradually reaching eighty million man soul!\n\nThe dream realm trading with Chi clan was continuing in secret.\n\nChi Qu You had come to terms with his situation.\n\nHe had made one misstep and now could only fall deeper into it.\n\nNaturally, Fang Yuan never let go of his guard against him. This rank eight Gu Immortal was not a simple person and might retaliate if not handled properly.\n\nFortunately, Fang Yuan had already chosen to support Chi clan in preparation for the future.\n\nChi clan obtained dream path research results from the transactions, this gave Chi Qu You pleasure amidst the pain: Since he had already made a terrible blunder by agreeing to this exchange, why not just continue with it?\n\nChi Qu You did not want to take a risk, but because Fang Yuan led him on this path, he could only clench his teeth and continue walking towards the abyss.\n\nIn his free time, Fang Yuan soul searched those Gu Immortal souls.\n\nAlthough he had done this in his previous life, he still did it again in this life because he wanted to look into something.\n\nThat was the ink effect.\n\nCompare to the previous life, the subtle differences in this life made Fang Yuan think deeply.\n\nAn indescribably mysterious feeling had been lingering in his mind.\n\n“Is this fate?” Fang Yuan felt like he had touched a strand of the web weaved by fate Gu.\n\nHe gradually felt a strong premonition: “If I continue researching this, my understanding of fate will become increasingly deeper. This is the best way to comprehend fate.”\n\n“After gathering more clues from a few more rebirths and making deductions, I might be able to conceive a mortal killer move that has the effect of fate.”\n\n“If I merge it with the profundities of luck path… that will be destiny huh…” Fang Yuan’s mind jolted slightly and his eyes shined with bright light.\n\nHeavenly Court.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was stationed in Embroidered Tower.\n\nThis small pavilion was adorned with beautiful decorations, its walls were red and its tiles were made of jade, looking exquisite and beautiful, but it lacked part of its foundational support; one could clearly see the traces of destruction on the Immortal Gu House.\n\nIn the sky above Embroidered Tower were three pieces of bloody skins directly sewn to the air that were still letting out traces of primal savagery.\n\nBack then when Reckless Savage Demon Venerable invaded Heavenly Court, he was stopped by Embroidered Tower. In the end, Reckless Savage Demon Venerable destroyed half of Embroidered Tower, which was still unable to be repaired by Heavenly Court, but he also left three pieces of bloody skins behind.\n\nEver since the defeat in Lang Ya blessed land, Feng Jiu Ge had been immersed in a deep state of comprehension.\n\nHe did not cultivate transformation path, but he came here purposely to comprehend a trace of ‘transformation’ from these three bloody skins.\n\nThis transformation was a kind of concept, it was the transformation of destiny, it was the injury of Reckless Savage Demon Venerable.\n\nReckless Savage Demon Venerable was strong while Embroidered Tower was weak, but the strong was forced to discard three pieces of skin by the weak, this was an unexpected change.\n\nHeavenly Court failed when invading Lang Ya blessed land, Southern Border Gu Immortals chased Fang Yuan but were captured instead, these were also similar kinds of unexpected changes.\n\nThis series of changes and transformations kept on resonating with depths of Feng Jiu Ge’s soul!\n\nThe deep state of comprehension gradually entered an optimal condition.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s lips curled up into a smile: “It seems that my next song will be — Destiny Song.”"
