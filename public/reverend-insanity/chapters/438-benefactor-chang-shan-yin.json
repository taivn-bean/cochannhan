Fang Yuan’s appearance gave them hope, but he also destroyed their hopes single-handedly!\n\nWind wolf king howled, causing the entire wind wolf pack to attack.\n\nJust as the two packs were about to engage in battle, Fang Yuan let out a loud howl.\n\nHe was human, but he emitted the cry of a wolf.\n\nThis call was desolate, it was wild, it was like a fire that was being blown by the wind in the night sky.\n\nThe wolf howl could be heard from eight hundred steps away, the poison beard wolves in this range turned frenzy upon hearing it, summoning twice their original battle strength!\n\n“Ah, this is the rank four wolf howl Gu, it can increase the battle strength of wolf packs temporarily, it is a precious Gu. This person is a rank four Gu Master!”\n\nFang Yuan’s howl was shocking, it changed the expressions of the Gu Masters.\n\nMany pairs of despairing eyes gave off hope once again.\n\nRank three and rank four were two different concepts.\n\nRank three was elder, rank four was leader.\n\nEven Ge Guang was only rank three upper stage.\n\nAfter recognising Fang Yuan’s cultivation level, nobody scolded him anymore. Although northern plains Gu Masters were brave, they were not arrogant, they were filled with respect for experts, and were humble towards strength.\n\nThe poison beard wolves were originally weaker than the wind wolves, but now their battle strength surged, and they quickly overwhelmed the wind wolves.\n\nAfter just a short battle, the wind wolves retreated, and a large number of wind wolf corpses were left on the battlefield. Over a dozen wind wolves were sacrificed for the life of one poison beard wolf.\n\n“What level of wolf enslavement skill is this!” Such a grand feat caused the Gu Masters to stare till their eyes fell out.\n\n“Unimaginable! This is the attainment of an enslavement master, who in the world is this person?” Many people looked at Fang Yuan like he was a monster.\n\n“I have never heard of such a hidden expert living in this area!” The gang was excited and shocked.\n\nFang Yuan’s strength caused the wind wolf pack’s attention to be placed on the poison beard wolves. They only surrounded the Ge tribe Gu Masters without attacking. This allowed these people to have a moment of rest under such circumstances.\n\n“The wind wolf king is here!” Ge Guang said, as everyone became nervous again.\n\nWind wolf king had higher intelligence, it howled and gathered the elites of its pack.\n\nVery soon, with wind wolf king as the arrowhead, these elites moved like an arrow, charging into the formation, straight into the center, and attacked Fang Yuan.\n\nEnslavement path Gu Masters were most afraid of ‘beheading the leader’ tactic, this wind wolf king was a thousand beast king, as it led the group of elites in attacking, they were simply unstoppable. Meanwhile, Fang Yuan only had a few hundred beast king level poison beard wolf kings.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was overjoyed instead of afraid, as he smiled lightly: “It could not resist it.”\n\nWind wolf king’s intelligence was higher than other wolves, but it was still a wild beast, it could not compare with humans. Against other wolf packs, Fang Yuan needed to charge himself, but when battling the wind wolf king, Fang Yuan could create this formation to attract the wind wolf king to charge towards him.\n\nSwoosh!\n\nWind wolf king who was sprinting opened its mouth and shot out three large wind blades.\n\nThe wind blades flew ahead and sliced through the wolf pack, creating a path as it targeted Fang Yuan.\n\n“Careful!” A Gu Master on the mound could not help but scream, as the others were extremely nervous.\n\nFang Yuan did not move, he waited for the wind blades to get near him before manipulating the hump wolf to evade, easily and narrowly avoid them, as the green-blue wind blades passed right beside him.\n\n“Expert!” Fang Yuan’s calm and composed demeanor made the Gu Masters think of this word.\n\nFang Yuan willed and several poison beard wolf kings were already prepared, charging forward and forming a formation, blocking the Wind wolf king.\n\nWind wolf king’s speed was fast, and had strong attacks with sturdy defenses, it was stronger than any of the poison beard wolf kings. And yet, it could not break through this barrier.\n\nFang Yuan’s precise control allowed him to overcome a stronger foe, restraining the wind wolf king as it could only howl angrily and helplessly.\n\n“Formidable! The great wind wolf king is being toyed by this man.”\n\n“This person’s enslavement skill is on par with Jiang Bao Ya, Yang Po Ying, and Ma Zun. Northern plains has a new first-rate enslavement expert now!”\n\n“If his wolf pack is stronger by a few times, he could take on a small-mid tribe single-handedly!”\n\n“Who is this person? He looks rather old.” Ge Guang was in a daze looking at Fang Yuan deal with the wind wolf king, feeling great admiration in his heart.\n\nEveryone shook their heads, guessing among themselves, this gave Fang Yuan an aura of mystery.\n\n“It is about time.” Fang Yuan muttered.\n\nHe had the entire battle in his grasp, seeing that the wind wolf king was about to escape, he knew that its battle intent was gone.\n\n“Rank three wolf enslavement Gu, go!”\n\nFang Yuan willed, and his sole rank three wolf enslavement Gu flew out and turned into a light smoke, engulfing the Wind wolf king.\n\nWind wolf king howled as it struggled, holding on as it did not submit to Fang Yuan’s authority.\n\n“Hmph.” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone brightly, he had a hundred man soul, he was not afraid of such competition between souls.\n\nAs expected, after a while, the wind wolf king could not resist anymore and submitted to Fang Yuan.\n\n“This person’s soul is extremely strong, he most likely has a hundred man soul!” Someone exclaimed.\n\n“With such skill in enslavement, it is not strange that he has a hundred man soul.” Someone rebuked: “Like Jiang Bao Ya, Yang Po Ying, and Ma Zun, they all have thousand man souls!”\n\nAfter successfully planting the wolf enslavement Gu, Fang Yuan obtained his first thousand wolf king.\n\nWind wolf king howled, and the wolf pack stood its movement, the noisy battlefield turned silent.\n\nThe remaining thousand wind wolves obeyed the wind wolf king and joined Fang Yuan.\n\nThis way, Fang Yuan’s wolf pack size doubled, reaching two thousand and four hundred wolves.\n\n“I was lucky this time, if not for these Gu Masters restraining the wolves, I would have had a pay a bigger price to subdue this wind wolf king.” Fang Yuan rode on the hump wolf as he gradually moved towards the mound.\n\nGe Guang and gang were holding their breaths, this person would decide their life and death.\n\nAs Fang Yuan got closer, Ge Guang stood out from the crowd and placed his right hand at his chest, bowing deeply at Fang Yuan, shouting: “Esteemed expert, your strength brings me great admiration and reverence. Now, our lives are in your hands. To live or to die, we will listen to your command, we will not have any complaints.”\n\n“Hehehe, young warrior, I saw your battle earlier. You are as brave as a stallion, it reminds me of myself in the past.” Fang Yuan sat on the wolf’s back, laughing as he looked at the people warmly: “You are the first batch of humans I’ve seen since I left poison grassland. I am very happy to return to this land, rest assured I, Chang Shan Yin, am not a cruel and wicked person.”\n\nHearing Fang Yuan’s words, the Gu Masters laughed as they relaxed.\n\nThey had little primeval essence left now, if Fang Yuan wanted to kill them, they had no way of retaliating.\n\nSometimes, men were more dangerous than wolves. If they met a demonic Gu Master, their outcomes would be even more tragic. Right now, everyone felt glad, they thought that they had met a righteous expert.\n\n“Benefactor Chang Shan Yin, I am Ge tribe’s young tribe leader, you saved my life, allow me to repay this debt. Let me invite you to our tent as a guest, I will do my best to make your stay an enjoyable one.” Ge Guang invited earnestly.\n\nOf course, gratitude was a part of the reason, but he was also looking at Fang Yuan’s strength. The chance of become familiar with an expert was not just good for him, it benefited the entire tribe as well.\n\n“Ge tribe?” Fang Yuan thought for a while: “Alright, I have already expended my primeval stones, and I also need to replenish my Gu worms, I do need to rest and reorganise.”\n\nHe subtly expressed his needs and requests, it was a hint to Ge Guang.\n\nWithout disappointing him, this young clan leader’s eyes shone as he memorised these words to heart, laughing heartily: “Benefactor Chang Shan Yin, thank you for accepting, then let me lead the way.”"
