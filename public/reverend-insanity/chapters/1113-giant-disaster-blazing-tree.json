  "content": "To eliminate these treemen, he would need to expend a lot of immortal essence.\n\nThe number of these treemen was greater than the first earthly calamity’s snow monsters, and they had strong regenerative abilities. Fang Yuan could see many severed twigs that were stabbed into the ground growing with new budding leaves.\n\nUnless he used killer moves like triple layered sword wave to completely decimate these treemen, to avoid any future problems.\n\nOtherwise, when these trees grow, they would expend a great amount of the earth qi inside the immortal aperture.\n\nBut using triple layered sword wave or flying sword Immortal Gu to kill these treemen was too wasteful!\n\n“If I were a fire path Gu Immortal, this would not be a problem to me.” Fang Yuan thought of this, when he suddenly heard a sound, fire was starting from those treemen’s corpses.\n\nThe fire burnt rapidly, in the blink of an eye, it spread and covered countless treemen!\n\nThe fire continued to rage on these treemen’s bodies, turning these treemen into charcoal, their leaves were completely incinerated, a great number of them died.\n\nThe fire was nourished by the treemen and became larger, it was almost twenty meters tall!\n\nRaging flames advanced towards Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan was stunned.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nEvidently, this was part of the earthly calamity.\n\nBut why did the earthly calamity start burning itself? What was heaven’s will trying to do? Was it trying to resolve Fang Yuan’s problem?\n\nFang Yuan quickly ruled out the possibility.\n\nWhat a joke, how could heaven’s will help him?\n\nRoar—!\n\nThere was a huge figure standing among the roaring flames.\n\nIn the orange-red flames, a sixty meter tall giant stood up!\n\n“This is?!” Fang Yuan’s pupils shrunk to pin size, he subconsciously gritted his teeth: “Giant disaster blazing tree!”\n\nThis was an ancient desolate plant.\n\nIn history, immemorial red heaven often had these giant disaster blazing trees.\n\nBut this type of ancient desolate plant was rarely seen in the five regions, although not extinct.\n\nGiant disaster blazing trees could be created from any type of tree. When a forest fire starts, after countless lifeforms are killed, there was a chance of forming this giant disaster blazing tree.\n\nThe giant disaster blazing tree’s body was covered in raging flames. It burned endlessly, nothing could get close to it. More impressively, this giant disaster blazing tree would cause bad luck to whatever life forms got close to it.\n\n“Heaven’s will, truly insidious! Evidently, heaven’s will has noticed the protection of Dog Shit Luck on me, it created this giant disaster blazing tree to destroy my good luck!”\n\nFang Yuan felt a huge challenge.\n\nNormally speaking: If he encountered a giant disaster blazing tree in the wild, he would wisely choose to evade it. But now, this giant disaster blazing tree directly appeared in his immortal aperture, it was draining his immortal aperture’s earth qi and bringing him disaster and bad luck, negating Dog Shit Luck’s effect. If he left it alone, soon, Fang Yuan would be extremely unlucky, nothing would go right, he might even face a huge disaster. As for refining Immortal Gu, he could forget about it.\n\nFlames raged on, crackling sounds could be heard from the burning trees.\n\nThe blazing tree had appeared in a very peculiar location, it was close to Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan activated his defenses, the huge flames were still causing his eyebrows and hair to dry up.\n\n“This is only the periphery, but the temperature is already like this, what would the center of this blazing tree be like?” Fang Yuan sighed, leaving.\n\nHe left Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nHe had Landscape as Before, he could restore Dang Hun Mountain before it was completely destroyed.\n\nThe problem was how to kill this giant disaster blazing tree which reached partway up Dang Hun Mountain in height!\n\nSword marks targeting death!\n\nTriple layered sword wave!\n\nPoison spit!\n\nFang Yuan used many killer moves, but they were ineffective. The poison in the air was completely eradicated by the flames, flying sword Immortal Gu pierced the giant disaster blazing tree and returned to Fang Yuan, but the giant disaster blazing tree only shook intensely, before turning to normal.\n\nAs for triple layered sword wave, it managed to put out the flames, it got to the blazing tree and destroyed many branches and leaves. But soon, the flames spread again as the blazing tree returned to normal, its injuries vanished after a few breaths of time.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shone with brilliance, immortal aura burst out around him as he cried out: “Strength path giant hand!’\n\nBam.\n\nA giant hand appeared out of nowhere, pushing the air and grabbing at the blazing tree with an unstoppable aura.\n\nBut the blazing tree was huge too, it was almost half of Dang Hun Mountain’s size.\n\nThe strength path giant hand grabbed the giant disaster blazing tree and tried to lift it up.\n\nBut after some time, even after trying hard, there was no effect.\n\nThe giant disaster blazing tree had countless roots, they were like snakes deeply rooted in the soil, sucking in earth qi fiercely, it also had the spring dawn jade orioles flying in the sky to replenish its life force, it was stable as a mountain, unmoving.\n\nAs time passed, the entire strength path giant hand started melting in the flames, almost half of it was gone.\n\nFang Yuan dispelled this giant hand, he had an idea after some inspiration.\n\nRumble!\n\nA second strength path giant hand flew out, but this time, it grabbed at Dang Hun Mountain instead of the giant disaster blazing tree.\n\nFang Yuan could not lift the giant disaster blazing tree, but strength path giant hand had the power of Pulling Mountain, he could lift Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nWind currents blew, Dang Hun Mountain was brought into the air by Fang Yuan, before he tossed it directly towards the giant disaster blazing tree.\n\nWith a loud sound, the entire ground shook intensely.\n\nThe giant disaster blazing tree was suppressed under the mountain, the huge flames were no longer apparent, there was only a ring of fire left around the mountain’s base.\n\nFang Yuan floated in the air, staring at the battlefield expressionlessly.\n\nThe giant disaster blazing tree could not move, it was attacked by Dang Hun Mountain’s soul path dao marks, but it had incredible vitality and tenacity, it was still struggling intensely.\n\nBlazing flames started to roast Dang Hun Mountain, liquefying some of its rocks.\n\nIt was not so easy to get rid of the giant disaster blazing tree.\n\nFang Yuan was in a heavy mood, looking around, it was a scene of red.\n\nA sea of fire!\n\nThe flames had spread to the entire forest, and even the grassland.\n\nAs expected, heaven’s will’s arrangements were just to nurture the growth of the giant disaster blazing tree, how could it be so nice to him?\n\nFang Yuan’s breathing became rougher.\n\nHe saw that more and more giant disaster blazing trees were forming in the sea of fire, their roots were digging into the ground as they sucked in earth qi to strengthen themselves.\n\nThe first plant was not destroyed yet, but so many others were forming!\n\nNot just that, these giant disaster blazing trees were growling, they stood up and turned into giant blazing treemen!\n\nThey had only one target, Fang Yuan, who was in the sky.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nUnder Dang Hun Mountain, the first giant disaster blazing tree also became a treeman, it was not giving up, attempting to flip over this mountain.\n\nIt had incredible strength, each time it struggled, Dang Hun Mountain shook intensely, causing a huge and scary sound.\n\nIn an instant, the situation became as bad as it possibly could!\n\nFang Yuan could ignore the snow monsters earlier and slowly kill them\n\nBut he could not ignore these giant disaster blazing treemen. Even though they moved slowly, they had a terrible influence on the immortal aperture. Not only did they suck away earth qi and damage the sovereign immortal aperture’s foundation, they would even bring Fang Yuan a lot of bad luck!\n\nWhat should he do?\n\nThe light of the fire flickered on Fang Yuan’s face, a smile slowly appeared on his face: “Thankfully, I made my preparations!”\n\nAt the same time, Shang Xin Ci who was in Southern Border stared at the lamp in front of her in a daze. In the fire, it seemed to show Fang Yuan’s former appearance.\n\n“Brother Hei Tu…” Shang Xin Ci thought to herself.\n\n“Clan leader, clan leader?” She heard something close to her ears.\n\n“Ah.” Shang Xin Ci regained her senses, she looked at Xiao Lan, Xiao Die, Lady Wei, Zhou Quan, and her other subordinates.\n\n“Sorry, my mind was wandering again.” Shang Xin Ci quickly apologized.\n\n“Miss, this is the third time you’ve gone into a daze.” Xiao Lan muttered.\n\n“I was disrespectful, I am truly sorry.” Shang Xin Ci quickly said again.\n\nZhou Quan and Lady Wei glanced at each other swiftly, before coughing: “Now, let’s continue the topic from before, how will we take in the Gu Master groups that were controlled by Shang clan’s former young clan leaders.”\n\nAfter the meeting, everyone left the hall.\n\n“Xiao Die, how is the clan leader? Why is she constantly in a daze?” Zhou Quan asked.\n\nXiao Die showed an expression of worry: “I am not sure too, it seems that after the higher-ups met with her, she became like this ever since.”\n\n“Higher-ups?” Zhou Quan’s expression changed, he already knew about the existence of Shang clan’s Gu Immortals, this was not something that he could settle or interfere in.\n\nYe Fan could not hold it in anymore: “Let me go talk to Lady Xin Ci, maybe as an outsider, I can learn something from her.”\n\n“Young master Ye, you are not an outsider.” Xiao Lan smiled.\n\n“We will trouble you, young master Ye.” Lady Wei nodded, agreeing with this.\n\nA moment later, Ye Fan arrived at Shang Xin Ci’s study room.\n\nThe doors were shut.\n\nThrough the small hole in the center, Ye Fan saw that Shang Xin Ci was holding onto a piece of paper, looking at it carefully.\n\nShe was so deep in thought, even when Ye Fan walked with heavy steps, she did not notice it.\n\nYe Fan was about to cough and remind Shang Xin Ci that he was here.\n\nBut suddenly, he heard Shang Xin Ci’s soft whisper: “Brother Hei Tu… what kind of person are you…”\n\nYe Fan’s heart jumped, he instantly understood, the paper in Shang Xin Ci’s hand was none other than the black demon’s arrest warrant. It was his drawing!\n\nYe Fan felt a sense of hollowness in his heart, his strong limbs were turning frail.\n\nHe stood outside the door, he hesitated for a long time before gritting his teeth, turning around and leaving.\n\nFrom start to finish, Shang Xin Ci did not discover him.\n\nYe Fan walked out of the mansion, arriving at the street. This was the inner core of Shang Liang Mountain, an important place in Shang clan, it was flourishing with bustling activity.\n\nBut Ye Fan had a worried expression, he had a question inside him — Hei Tu, what kind of person are you?\n\nNorthern icy plain.\n\nChu Du’s arms were behind his back, he watched this vast icy plain.\n\nSuddenly, his body shook: “It’s here!”\n\nHe received Fang Yuan’s transmission and quickly used the Immortal Gu in his hands.\n\nRank seven calamity beckoning Immortal Gu!\n\nAt the next moment, the sovereign blessed land’s entrance opened.\n\nFirst, spring dawn jade orioles were sent out of the entrance by a formless force, next, one by one, the giant disaster blazing trees were dragged out without managing to put up resistance!\n\nThey were unwilling, they were furious.\n\nThe sky was rumbling with thunder, heaven’s will was furious too.\n\nBut it was no use!\n\nTwo hours later, the third earthly calamity ended.\n\nFang Yuan collected his immortal aperture, appearing in the northern icy plain.\n\nChu Du obtained quite a bit of Reckless Savage’s true meaning, he cried out with an excited tone: “Walking on a long road for countless years, today I obtain the blessing of azure clouds. Flying above rivers and lakes on these clouds, nothing can obstruct my view of this world.”\n\nHis voice resounded over the surroundings, the disposition of the Domination Immortal was fully emanated.\n\n“May I ask you for your name?” Chu Du greeted Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan smiled lightly: “Obstacles and difficulties fill this road, life and death matters little against calamities and tribulations. My body flies like willows with the wind, regardless of wind or mud I still fly free.”\n\nAfter pausing, he returned the greeting to Chu Du, saying plainly: “I am Liu Guan Yi.”"
