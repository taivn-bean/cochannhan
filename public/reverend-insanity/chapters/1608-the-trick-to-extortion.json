  "content": "It was obvious what Fang Yuan was busy with.\n\nHaving the Southern Border immortals in his hands, Fang Yuan had firm hold of the initiative and occupied huge dominance.\n\nHe had such invaluable hostages in hand, he could extort however he wanted.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was cautious and did not overdo it. He only extorted three clans at first.\n\nXia clan was undeniably the main target. First supreme elder Xia Cha was Xia clan’s only rank eight Gu Immortal, she was Xia clan’s foundational pillar, an extremely important person. Xia clan simply could not lose her, or else the whole clan’s force would shrink by seventy to eighty percent!\n\nYi clan was the second.\n\nBecause the Yi clan Gu Immortal Fang Yuan had taken captive was Yi Yang.\n\nThis space path Gu Immortal was the strongest rank seven expert of Yi clan, and everyone was optimistic of him having the qualifications to enter rank eight. More importantly, he was blood related to Yi clan’s first supreme elder, and was a successor of the clan being nurtured by the first supreme elder.\n\nIn Fang Yuan’s first life of five hundred years, during the five regions chaotic war, there were endless internal conflicts in Southern Border. Yi Yang was schemed against and fell into Shang clan’s hands, Yi clan’s first supreme elder had not hesitated to pay an enormous price to bring back Yi Yang.\n\nSo Fang Yuan was rather expectant of Yi clan’s ransom.\n\nFinally, the third was Chi clan.\n\nFang Yuan’s Chi clan Gu Immortal captive was Chi clan’s second supreme elder, which was a very important position! Adding on that Chi Qu You had transacted with Fang Yuan previously, obtaining dream path research gains, it was natural for Chi clan to compromise.\n\nFang Yuan was deeply aware of the human mindset, his first extortion targets was not Wu clan, who hated him deeply, nor Tie clan, who deeply detested the demonic path.\n\nAs long as these three clans gave in, it would be much easier for Fang Yuan to extort other Southern Border righteous path forces.\n\nAfter all, with these precedents, the righteous path would not be so tough in their stance anymore.\n\nInside the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nMini Green Heaven, at the immortal formation.\n\nImmortal killer move — Great Thief Ghost Hand!\n\nThe ghost hand entered Yi Yang’s immortal aperture and returned with a rank seven Immortal Gu.\n\nYing Wu Xie and the Formation Spirit looked on quietly from the side with impassive expressions.\n\nThey were no longer surprised by this sight.\n\nBecause in this period of time, Fang Yuan had already looted a huge amount of Immortal Gu! Moreover, he had even looted Xia Cha’s two rank eight Immortal Gu, Spring and Summer. With such sensational gains, the remaining loot looked mild in comparison.\n\nFang Yuan had constructed another immortal formation to refine these Immortal Gu.\n\nThis immortal formation used wisdom refinement formation as the foundation along with many wisdom path Immortal Gu to form a completely new version.\n\nWisdom refinement formation was constructed by using the light of wisdom along with Woman’s Heart and Unravel Mystery to refine other Immortal Gu. If there was the other person’s will, the effect would become even more outstanding. Fang Yuan had used Mo Yao’s fake will to help him refine the Immortal Gu he had obtained from Bo Qing’s immortal zombie body, including change soul Immortal Gu, which had been of the utmost significance in the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain.\n\nAt present, Fang Yuan still used the light of wisdom as the core, the brand new wisdom refinement formation was even more powerful.\n\nWisdom Gu was a rank nine Gu, so it was truly easy to suppress those rank seven Immortal Gu.\n\nMoreover, with the large improvement in Fang Yuan’s formation path and wisdom path methods, the wisdom refinement formation’s effect became even more remarkable.\n\nAfter a while, Fang Yuan finished refining the newly stolen Immortal Gu.\n\nThis was a space path Immortal Gu that looked like a blue jade sphere with a pair of snow-white wings.\n\nFang Yuan recognized this Gu, it was called Space Travel and had a remarkable movement ability. Shadow Sect’s true inheritances had relevant records, for instance, this Gu was initially captured from the body of an immemorial desolate beast level pegasus.\n\nFang Yuan stored this space travel Gu.\n\nHe did not cultivate space path and had ordinary attainment in it, moreover, he did not have many space path dao marks.\n\nHowever, he had too many true inheritances, countless immortal killer moves and Immortal Gu recipes, he did not lack methods to make use of Immortal Gu.\n\nBy now, he had already stolen most of the Immortal Gu of the Southern Border Gu Immortal captives.\n\nAs for the issue of the shortage of immortal essence, it was already solved.\n\nXia clan’s one million immortal essence stones were like a waterfall descending from a heavenly river and pouring on this parched land.\n\nOne million immortal essence stones meant one million beads of green grape immortal essence, which was equivalent to ten thousand beads of red date immortal essence. This amount had already far surpassed Fang Yuan’s highest record of red date immortal essence.\n\nFang Yuan continued to use great thief ghost hand but he was not able to take out any more Immortal Gu from Yi Yang’s body.\n\nThereupon, he threw this person back into dream realm, and dragged out another person. It was Chi clan’s second supreme elder, an earth path rank seven Gu Immortal.\n\nFang Yuan made a move on him without hesitation.\n\nHe was going to take out Immortal Gu of all these Southern Border Gu Immortals and store them in his pockets.\n\nAs for the people, he would have to release some of them.\n\nExtortion or blackmailing could be seen as a form of transaction, where as long as the seller was powerful enough, the buyer could only remain helpless. And in a transaction, buyers and sellers needed to pay attention to reputation, if he did not release some hostages, why would Southern Border’s righteous path believe Fang Yuan, how could he continue his extortion plan to gain huge benefits?\n\nFang Yuan intended to first release Chi clan’s second supreme elder and Yi clan’s Yi Yang.\n\nHe had done transactions with Chi clan previously after all, and he also intended to support Chi clan in the future, to resist Heavenly Court. Naturally, he was definitely going to extort these two clans to the limit.\n\nDespite it being difficult to raise a Gu Immortal, a hostage’s price was fixed and limited.\n\nThese righteous path forces could stay in power until now, they were not fools.\n\nIf Fang Yuan’s demands were too much and exceeded the value of these Gu Immortals, or the acceptable price that these clansmen were willing to pay, they would not do this unreasonable transaction.\n\nAll in all, extortion was a skill.\n\nSeveral days later, another batch of immortal essence stones was obtained.\n\nThat was Yi clan’s first ransom, one million and two hundred thousand immortal essence stones.\n\nComparing value, Yi Yang could not compare to Xia Cha, but Yi clan had a lot of wealth, at least richer than Xia clan. So they had much more immortal essence stones reserved in their hands.\n\nA super force’s immortal essence stones reserve was more or less around one million immortal essence stones.\n\nSo Fang Yuan first extorted immortal essence stones, not only because he himself was in shortage of it, the more important reason was that other forces could totally take that sum out. Although it was not without a level of difficulty, the difficulty was small.\n\nFirst make them give in, then continue to extort them more harshly, making them bleed little by little. Fang Yuan was well versed in the ways of extortion.\n\n“It is just that although I captured Southern Border immortals, I did not receive any response from Heavenly Court. What did Heavenly Court prepare in the River of Time?”\n\nFang Yuan could not help but think.\n\nHe constructed years flow execution formation mainly to deal with the Southern Border immortals, but it was also to lure Heavenly Court into making a move.\n\nIf Heavenly Court had laid an ambush and saw the commotion there, they could have followed the tributary of the River of Time to pincer-attack Fang Yuan.\n\nBut from the start to finish, Fang Yuan did not see Heavenly Court’s ambush.\n\nFang Yuan’s scheme was fruitless in this regard, leaving him with even more wariness and suspicion."
