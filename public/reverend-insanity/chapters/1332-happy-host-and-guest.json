  "content": "Chi Shang drank a lot, his face was red, he spoke a lot.\n\nIt seemed that after defeating Fang Yuan in this contest, his confidence had risen sharply, he felt that he could obtain the love of his life.\n\nGu Immortals had all sorts of methods to prevent getting drunk. But that way, the joy of drinking would be gone, and it was very rude to their drinking buddies.\n\nFang Yuan quickly raised his cup, drinking the wine as he smiled: “If that is the case, I will admit I am unlucky, it was too bad that I had a competitor like you! Sigh…”\n\nFang Yuan sighed to himself, as if lamenting that the heavens saw fit to put someone so gifted in his way, he expressed that sentiment fully in his act.\n\nChi Shang laughed loudly, stretching out his arm and patting Fang Yuan’s shoulder, consoling him.\n\nFang Yuan laughed internally.\n\nThis Chi Shang was so innocent and pure.\n\nThis matter was decided long ago.\n\nAs long as Fang Yuan agreed, Qiao Si Liu would enter his embrace, this was a certain thing.\n\nBut Qiao Si Liu did not express her intention clearly, because this fairy had her schemes and pride, she wanted to play hard to get, so as to raise her own value.\n\nActually, Fang Yuan could tell very clearly.\n\nLike this time, Qiao Si Liu’s letter was the expression of her attitude.\n\n“Qiao Si Liu is seeing that Chi Shang and I are competing, she is very happy about it. Earlier, she had been watching on the fence, this suited her intentions.”\n\n“When I lost, she then took the initiative to tell me about the situation between her and Chi Shang. She wants to console me and let me know that she has no feelings for Chi Shang. It was his one sided affection.”\n\n“But this clever woman did not state her attitude clearly, she just talked about a fact to show her purity, while showing that she had a lot of value to her suitors.”\n\nIt was natural instinct for men to pursue women. How many men pursued her, and the type of men that went after her, these somewhat determined the perceived value of a woman.\n\n“Qiao Si Liu is seeking to be with me, this is not her personal wish, but the political desire of Qiao clan.”\n\n“And with just this, I am already ahead of all her suitors.”\n\n“No matter how many times I fail, no matter how many women I go after, no matter how weak I am, even if I make a scene like during the moon festival, so what?”\n\n“I am already victorious!”\n\n“In fact, even if I go after another woman instead of Qiao Si Liu, she will turn around and pursue me instead.”\n\n“Of course, this is not love, this is… politics!”\n\nFang Yuan sneered in his mind, he had seen through everything.\n\nBut he could not accept this ‘love’ from Qiao Si Liu.\n\nOnce he accepted it, he would be dragged into this vicious political spiral, he would no longer be simply Wu Yi Hai, he would be the key pawn that Qiao clan had inserted into Wu clan to fight for their own benefits.\n\nWu Yong would no longer give him such a relaxed environment like now, he would keep Fang Yuan under close observation, suppressing him and maintaining alertness against this brother.\n\nIf that happened, would Fang Yuan be able to enter the dream realms easily?\n\nEvidently, he could not, he might even get exposed.\n\nAnd that would lead to greater problems.\n\nOnce Fang Yuan’s identity was exposed, he would face the attacks of Qiao clan, because they were a righteous path force, they had to keep a clear distance from Fang Yuan, and Wu clan and Qiao clan would try to defend their own reputation by going after Fang Yuan with all their effort, far more than the other clans.\n\n“However, even though I cannot accept it, and won’t accept it, I can make use of this ‘love’.”\n\nUsing Qiao Si Liu, Fang Yuan would make Wu Yong more alert, he would arrange for Fang Yuan to be sent back to the super Gu formation, Fang Yuan’s goal would be achieved.\n\nOf course, there was nothing perfect in this world, even though this method was brilliant, it had its drawbacks.\n\nWu Yong’s alertness, Luo Mu Zi, Lun Fei, and Chi Shang, as well as Qiao Si Liu’s other suitors were all lingering problems.\n\nThere was pure love in this world, but it was indeed rare.\n\nWhen people lived in this world, they had to consider many things.\n\nQiao Si Liu’s beauty, background, cultivation level and others, these were alluring temptations.\n\nAmong her suitors, Chi Shang was the purest, but he still considered the element of formation path, not to mention the others.\n\nAs for Fang Yuan, he was the most special one.\n\nChi Shang’s arrival was not out of Fang Yuan’s expectations.\n\nIn fact, he was mentally prepared.\n\nEven without Chi Shang, others were going to come and find problems. Even if they did not come now, they would in the future.\n\nBecause Fang Yuan was approaching Qiao Si Liu, and the benefits associated with her, he angered many people. Among these people, there were suitors, and there were forces behind them after the benefits.\n\nAs the saying goes, beautiful women are trouble.\n\nA beauty was not easy to pursue.\n\nOnly a naive person would think of using love and emotions to conquer a beauty.\n\nActually, there was far more.\n\nA woman’s beauty was her natural dowry.\n\nThis dowry was extremely valuable, it was a huge amount of wealth.\n\nWho would not want such wealth?\n\nBut not everyone could protect this wealth.\n\nIf a beauty was willing to give this wealth to her partner out of pure love, then this lucky person should treat her well.\n\nBut the truth was, such situations were too few.\n\nIf it happened, treasure it, if it didn’t, don’t bank on it.\n\nThis was not ‘unseemly’.\n\nThis was — reality.\n\nWhen Fang Yuan returned to the super Gu formation, he started to think of how to settle the aftermath of this.\n\nA true chessmaster would consider many steps ahead before even moving.\n\nIn fact, when Fang Yuan decided to use Qiao Si Liu’s ‘love’ to achieve his goals, he had already started to think of how to resolve the fallout of this issue.\n\nIf he handled it badly, Chi Shang would be only the first one here. The second, third, and so on, these people would be unending.\n\nThis would be huge interference for Fang Yuan’s exploration of the dream realm.\n\nAt the same time, Wu Yi Hai’s identity restricted Fang Yuan greatly in dealing with these challenges, he could not expose himself during the process.\n\nFang Yuan needed to resolve this problem carefully and accurately.\n\nHow?\n\nIt was difficult, and yet easy.\n\nHe would create a target, someone who would attract the attention of those suitors.\n\nFang Yuan had been expecting people to find trouble with him.\n\nChi Shang came here at such an opportune time, Fang Yuan was secretly happy about it.\n\nWhen he looked through Chi Shang’s information, his joy increased by several times!\n\nHis opponent’s stupidity was his own fortune.\n\nOf course, there was a point: Such stupidity had nothing to do with IQ or EQ.\n\nThere was a clear example from Earth, it was Yue Fei <sup>1</sup> .\n\nYue Fei went on a campaign, and when he was about to succeed, the emperor he served used twelve golden plaques to recall him back to the capital, and executed him on false charges.\n\nThe reason?\n\nWas the emperor being stupid?\n\nHe was!\n\nBut were the emperor and officials idiots?\n\nThey were not!\n\nIf Yue Fei succeeded in his campaign, the reputation of his personal army would rise greatly, the emperor’s authority would be lower than this general, the threat was too big. And most importantly, if Yue Fei won, he would bring back the former emperor. Then what would the current emperor do?\n\nAnd now, Chi clan’s first supreme elder, Chi Qu You, intentionally nurtured a Gu Immortal like Chi Shang, was he senile, did he not know that a person like Chi Shang, who was focused on researching formation path and had no capabilities in political conflicts, would eventually become a tool that was used?\n\nHe was not senile of course, he nurtured Chi Shang extensively precisely because he knew this.\n\nBecause his son needed to be the first supreme elder, he needed a ‘tool’ to assist his son, Chi Shang was the chosen one.\n\nMany people thought that Chi Shang was Fang Yuan’s problem.\n\nBut that was not the case from Fang Yuan’s perspective, he felt like this was an opportunity.\n\nIf he handled this well, he would resolve all the future problems ahead, he would be able to peacefully explore the dream realm and raise his foundation for the following period of time.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan had to lose.\n\nIf he did not lose, how would he create the bigger threat than himself, Chi Shang?\n\nWithout this meat shield, how would he divert all of the attention away?\n\nChi Shang was the easiest to plot against.\n\nFrom his information, Fang Yuan knew that Chi Shang loved to research formation path, he was most skilled in answering problems, and creating the necessary Gu formations.\n\nFang Yuan thus challenged him using this.\n\nAs a researcher, Chi Shang had his unique pride in this domain he was specialized in.\n\nHe could ignore everything else, he did not pay attention to his appearance, nor did he have any interest in fortune, but he cared about this. Because this was the meaning of his life!\n\nFang Yuan, a transformation path Gu Immortal, was using this to challenge him, this was a huge slap on Chi Shang’s face to begin with.\n\nHow could Chi Shang endure this?\n\nHe could not.\n\nThus, he fell into the trap that Fang Yuan had set, he could not climb out.\n\nNot only was he stuck in the trap, he even toasted Fang Yuan, feeling that Fang Yuan was a very sincere person!\n\n“You are a competitor, but, but what can I say? We are truly friends made after a fight, haha…” Chi Shang laughed, placing his arm around Fang Yuan’s shoulder.\n\n“Enough talking, let’s drink!” Fang Yuan gulped.\n\nChi Shang stared at Fang Yuan with wide eyes, he gave a thumbs up and said: “Brother, you are so cool! Let’s drink!”\n\nBoth sides continued to empty their cups.\n\n“Good wine.” Chi Shang sighed: “Sigh, to speak the truth, this is the first time I am drinking so much…”\n\nFang Yuan laughed heartily, but he was unmoved inside.\n\nThe wine of the righteous path was not so easy to drink.\n\nThe demonic path fought and killed, they were direct in their actions. The banquets of the righteous path was shrouded in rumors and suspicions, they were filled with schemes and plots, all sorts of devious thoughts were like undercurrents, waiting to sweep unknowing prey into the abyss.\n\nFang Yuan lost the challenge to Chi Shang, but he was very happy, he spread news about this.\n\nSo what if he lost?\n\nSometimes, losing was a way to achieve one’s goals.\n\nChi Shang was also very happy, he felt that this was the happiest he had ever been in a banquet.\n\nAt once, both the host and guest were happy."
