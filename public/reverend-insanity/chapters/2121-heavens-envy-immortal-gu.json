  "content": "From Du Zhi Xiao’s corpse, an Immortal Gu floated up and appeared on his chest.\n\nThis Immortal Gu seemed like it was made of crystals, it looked like a flea and was as large as a fist, curling up into a ball and staying completely silent.\n\n“This Immortal Gu allowed a mortal like Du Zhi Xiao to exert influence on the tribulation?” Li Xiao Bai cleaned the battlefield of loot, he naturally found this Immortal Gu.\n\nTo activate Immortal Gu, immortal essence was normally needed. But there were exceptions that did not face such a limitation.\n\n“It seems that this peculiar Immortal Gu can be activated by a mortal.” Su Qi Han said.\n\n“This Immortal Gu is very uncommon, let me check.” Imperial Minister Su looked at this Immortal Gu with a peculiar expression and used his information path methods.\n\nProfound Literature grotto-heaven was an information path grotto-heaven, it focused on collecting and accumulating information. Even though Profound Literature grotto-heaven was physically secluded, it had not dared to isolate itself from the world, it still maintained contact with the outside world.\n\nAnd Imperial Minister Su was an important person of the Imperial Court, with his authority, he could gain access to much of the Imperial Court’s secret information.\n\nSoon, he got the answer: “This is heaven’s envy Immortal Gu!”\n\n“Heaven’s envy Immortal Gu?” This was the first time that Su Qi Han had heard of this.\n\nImperial Minister Su explained: “Heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is a heaven path Immortal Gu, there are other similar Gu like heaven’s rage Immortal Gu, heaven’s sorrow Immortal Gu, and others. This type of heaven path Immortal Gu cannot be activated even by a rank nine venerable.”\n\n“Father, you must be wrong? We saw Du Zhi Xiao activate this Immortal Gu with our own eyes to create trouble for husband.” Su Qi Han retorted.\n\nImperial Minister Su shook his head: “I’m not done yet. Immortal Gu like Heaven’s Envy is quite special, it can resonate with emotions of envy and jealousy to activate itself. But the price to use it is huge, often requiring lifespan. Thus, Du Zhi Xiao turned from a young man to a middle aged man, before becoming an old man.”\n\nSu Qi Han was dazed, she could not help but think of <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, saying: “I remember that in <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, there are similar records. Don’t tell me strength Gu and wisdom Gu are also heaven path Gu worms?”\n\nImperial Minister Su smiled faintly: “I am not sure about that either, even though <<The Legends of Ren Zu>> states that, heaven path Gu worms cannot be used by any Gu cultivator, the most famous example is fate Gu. You’ve both seen the fight during the fate war yourselves.”\n\nSu Qi Han pouted unhappily, thinking: “I thought that this Immortal Gu would be useful to Xiao Bai, but to think that it is a heaven path Immortal Gu. This Immortal Gu requires envy and jealousy to activate on its own, but my husband is someone with great personality, a noble and special individual in this world, how can he have such emotions? And the price of using it is too high as well, the lifespan needed is too much!”\n\nImperial Minister Su saw his daughter’s disappointment, he smiled and said: “Xiao Bai, this heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is yours. As for how to deal with it, that is your matter. If you offer this Gu to the Imperial Court, according to the rules, you will be compensated.”\n\nSu Qi Han’s eyes shined with bright light.\n\nLi Xiao Bai pondered: “Can I exchange for an information path Immortal Gu?”\n\nImperial Minister Su had a difficult expression: “That…”\n\nSu Qi Han coyly grabbed Imperial Minister Su’s sleeves: “Father! Our heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is rank seven, we will take the loss and just exchange for some rank six information path Immortal Gu.”\n\nImperial Minister Su flicked his daughter’s forehead as he said jokingly: “You silly lass, you’re looking down on the Imperial Court. Do you think Gu Immortals are so stupid? Even if a heaven path Immortal Gu is rank eight, it has little actual value, it is far inferior to a rank six information path Immortal Gu.”\n\nFor her lover’s sake, Su Qi Han did not give up: “Father! You are the current Imperial Minister.”\n\nImperial Minister Su sighed, what else could he do, this was his beloved daughter.\n\n“I’ll think of a way and find a chance for Xiao Bai.” He answered.\n\nSu Qi Han smiled brightly, pressuring: “Father, I am sure that you can succeed!”\n\nImperial Minister Su smiled bitterly: “Little girl, I’ve never seen you so confident in your father before.”\n\nLi Xiao Bai was calm all along, he thought: “Father-in-law has many political rivals and enemies, if I ask him to get an Immortal Gu exchanged from the Imperial Court, he would face many obstructions, the chance of success is low. Even if he succeeds, he will lose a lot of his political power and bargaining chips, that is not a wise act.”\n\nThinking of this, Li Xiao Bai said: “Father-in-law, Han Er, no hurry in giving it up. I’ll try to put this heaven’s envy Immortal Gu up in treasure yellow heaven and see if anyone wants to buy it.”\n\nImperial Minister Su nodded: “That is a good idea, but Xiao Bai, don’t be too optimistic about it Even though heaven path Immortal Gu are rare, nobody can directly use them, this is a well known fact. Who would use their own useful Immortal Gu to exchange for an unusable heaven path Immortal Gu?”\n\nSu Qi Han sighed: “That is true.”\n\nLi Xiao Bai nodded: “I’ll just give it a try.”\n\nImperial Minister Su advised: “Don’t dwell on it, putting an Immortal Gu up on treasure yellow heaven requires a continuous fee.”\n\nLi Xiao Bai’s expression suddenly changed: “Someone bought heaven’s envy Immortal Gu!”\n\n“What?” Imperial Minister Su was stunned.\n\nSu Qi Han called out in joy: “What price did they pay?”\n\nLi Xiao Bai said with uncontainable excitement: “I… I already made the transaction. They are offering me rank seven poem wall Immortal Gu, this is an offer I cannot reject.”\n\nLi Xiao Bai’s immortal ascension did not have excess heaven and earth qi to refine his vital Gu into an Immortal Gu. A large part of the reason was due to heaven’s envy Immortal Gu.\n\nLi Xiao Bai did not have the ten extreme physiques, he only obtained a high grade blessed land.\n\nBut in this transaction, Li Xiao Bai obtained his first Immortal Gu, and it was rank seven at that.\n\nImperial Minister Su looked at the poem wall Immortal Gu in Li Xiao Bai’s hands, he stared in disbelief: “Someone actually bought this heaven path Immortal Gu? They even offered an information path Immortal Gu of the same rank? Which fool is this?”\n\nThe ‘fool’ that Imperial Minister Su spoke of was none other than Gu Yue Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan had always been paying attention to Li Xiao Bai’s situation. Even though Du Zhi Xiao and heaven’s envy Immortal Gu were out of his expectations, Fang Yuan had also not thought of interfering with Li Xiao Bai’s development, but having an Immortal Gu was simply too important to Li Xiao Bai.\n\nHe had to help in this aspect.\n\nTreasure yellow heaven was a safe place, nobody would be able to investigate the identities of the people undergoing this transaction.\n\nWith Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool, Fang Yuan had a high success rate in refining rank eight Immortal Gu, not to mention rank six or seven.\n\nThe time path clone directly refined poem wall Immortal Gu and raised it to rank seven.\n\nHe wanted to create some opportunity to hand this Immortal Gu to Li Xiao Bai, but to think that he would appear in treasure yellow heaven and sell heaven’s envy Immortal Gu.\n\nWith such a great opportunity, Fang Yuan immediately grabbed onto it.\n\nThe transaction ended quickly.\n\nLi Xiao Bai obtained rank seven poem wall Immortal Gu, even though he was only rank six and had insufficient cultivation level, this rank seven poem wall Immortal Gu was good enough to be his core Immortal Gu.\n\nOn the way back, Imperial Minister Su sighed to himself internally: This Li Xiao Bai’s luck was simply unrivaled!\n\n“So this heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is the thing that caused my luck resonance.” Fang Yuan obtained heaven’s envy Immortal Gu and found that Cooking Luck Pot was vibrating slightly.\n\nAfter inspecting it, he realized the truth of the matter.\n\nLooking at his silver light pillar again, the clouds on the surface had gathered into one, giving one a feeling of congruity. The clouds revolved around the pillar as they moved slowly, not only were they clearly defending it, they were rising up too, clashing with the clouds that were at the peak of the pillar of light.\n\nFang Yuan was deeply shaken: “It seems that this heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is the key to dealing with those venerables?”\n\nFang Yuan started to use wisdom path methods for deductions, sharp light flickered in his eyes for a long time, afterwards, he started to instill immortal essence into heaven’s envy Immortal Gu!\n\nHeaven’s envy Immortal Gu shook intensely, resisting him stubbornly. But it could not stop Fang Yuan’s powerful invasion, it started to falter.\n\nA moment later, heaven’s envy Immortal Gu absorbed a portion of the immortal essence and spat out a lump of grey smoke.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined with immense brilliance!\n\n“I actually refined a part of heaven’s envy Immortal Gu! Furthermore, I can actually activate a heaven path Immortal Gu!! Is it because of my unrestrained heavenly marks?”\n\nFang Yuan’s unrestrained heavenly marks had already passed ten thousand in number. Every grotto-heaven that he annexed would provide the sovereign immortal aperture with a number of heaven path dao marks, which would be refined by Fang Yuan into unrestrained heavenly marks.\n\nEarlier, he used his rank eight immortal essence to forcefully refine heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, he actually succeeded partially.\n\nAfterwards, he successfully activated heaven’s envy Immortal Gu!\n\nFang Yuan did not lose any lifespan.\n\nFang Yuan calmed down and inspected it carefully, he found out new information: “Even though I can activate heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, I cannot fully utilize it. I have only partially refined heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, I’ve only barely managed to gain its recognition. Thus, I cannot exert its full strength yet.”\n\nFang Yuan’s thoughts clashed rapidly: “This should be the result of having unrestrained heavenly marks, I am different from everyone else. If I continue gaining unrestrained heavenly marks, will I be able to further refine heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, or even completely refine it?”\n\n“Wait!”\n\nSuddenly, a flash of inspiration appeared in Fang Yuan’s mind, it was like lightning that pierced the darkness, creating a huge commotion in his mind!\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan’s lips became a bit dry: “Heaven’s envy Immortal Gu is a heaven path Immortal Gu, fate Gu is too. Since I can refine heaven’s envy Immortal Gu, does that mean that I can refine fate Gu and control fate as well?”\n\nSouthern Border.\n\nTribulations were raging, while Wu clan’s Gu Immortal Wu Zhen controlled the situation.\n\nHe focused his attention on that qi cocoon.\n\nSuddenly, a person shouted from within the cocoon, breaking out of it and creating an immortal aperture, becoming an immortal.\n\nIt was Wu Ji!\n\nIn this immortal ascension, not only did she obtain a super grade blessed land, her vital Gu even became an Immortal Gu.\n\nWu Zhen could feel Wu Ji’s aura, he sighed: “Wu Ji, you chose strength path after all.”\n\nWu Ji had no regret, she laughed: “This is precisely the path I seek!”\n\nAnd on Shang Liang Mountain.\n\nShang Yan Fei gathered his children in the same hall.\n\nHe had died on Yi Tian Mountain, but because of fate Gu’s destruction, he was revived by Shang clan’s Gu Immortals.\n\nRight now, he sat on the main seat with blood red light surrounding his body.\n\n“Congratulations to father for succeeding in the immortal ascension, you have surpassed the mortal realm and become a blood path immortal!” Shang Qiu Niu was the eldest son, he was the first to speak.\n\nAfter that, the rest of his children also congratulated him, including Shang Xin Ci.\n\nShang Yan Fei waved his hand: “Blood path has a poor reputation, keep the fact that I am now a blood path Gu Immortal as a secret. I gathered you here today because I want to distribute the family assets now, before I enter closed cultivation. The great era has arrived, I want you all to become immortals too and lead the new tides of this great era!”"
