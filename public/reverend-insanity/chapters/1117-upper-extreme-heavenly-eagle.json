  "content": "Chapter 1117: Upper Extreme Heavenly Eagle\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nUpper extreme heavenly eagle.\n\nFang Yuan had known about this immemorial desolate beast since long ago, but he did not know what its egg looked like.\n\nUpper extreme heavenly eagles were space path immemorial desolate beasts, a mature adult upper extreme heavenly eagle could freely travel in the immemorial nine heavens or in grotto-heavens.\n\nThis ability was amazing.\n\nOutside of the immemorial nine heavens, there were extremely thick heavenly wind qi walls. Grotto-heavens were situated in the sky, if they did not open up, it was hard to detect them from the outside world.\n\nBut as long as the upper extreme heavenly eagle had gone to a place before, it could follow its instincts and travel through space, returning to a former location.\n\nIt was an immemorial desolate beast with rank eight battle strength, it could fly extremely fast. Hei Fan could obtain an egg of the upper extreme heavenly eagle, he must have paid an extremely high price if it was not by chance.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle’s only weakness was its lifespan.\n\nIt only had eighty years of lifespan.\n\nOrdinary mortals had about a hundred years of lifespan.\n\nThe great immemorial desolate beast, upper extreme heavenly eagle, had less lifespan than even a mortal, it was truly astounding. Other immemorial desolate beasts often had hundreds of thousands of years to live, the upper extreme heavenly eagle could not compare to them.\n\nHowever, it had the ability to prolong its life.\n\nWhen it died of old age, it would produce an egg.\n\nInside this egg, there would be all of its memories as well as the accumulated space path dao marks over its entire life.\n\nWhen the chick breaks out of the shell, the upper extreme heavenly eagle would live another life, it would grow up again, but with its previous life’s memories and dao mark accumulation. Without any unexpected mishaps, the upper extreme heavenly eagle would only become stronger.\n\nOf course, when it is an egg or eagle chick, the upper extreme heavenly eagle would be at its weakest.\n\nAfter understanding this, Fang Yuan had a bold guess: “This upper extreme heavenly eagle’s egg must have been left behind by Hei Fan!”\n\nWhy did he leave behind this egg?\n\nEvidently, the upper extreme heavenly eagle had gone to Hei Fan grotto-heaven before. It was the key to entering it.\n\nHei tribe’s Gu Immortals had always been searching for the grotto-heaven that Hei Fan had left behind. But in Hei Cheng’s memories, they had no gains.\n\n“Hei Fan’s true inheritance must be inside his own grotto-heaven. This is not strange, because if he did not have food path methods, it would be best to keep all of his Immortal Gu inside the grotto-heaven and sustain their own feeding, that has most assurance.”\n\n“And Hei Fan grotto-heaven has no tribulations. According to Hei Cheng’s memories, Hei Fan had obtained a certain fragment of the immemorial nine heavens before his death. If I am not wrong, he must have fused this fragment of the immemorial nine heavens into his immortal aperture before dying.”\n\n“It is a pity, even though he has no tribulations, he had no lifespan Gu, his lifespan extension methods were also at their limits, he could only die.”\n\n“But why is the heavenly eagle egg inside the eagle nest dead?”\n\nFang Yuan was faced with a difficult question.\n\nThere were two answers.\n\nOne was that the heavenly eagle egg had naturally died. Hei Fan left the living egg behind, preventing it from hatching, he used the heavenly crystal eagle nest to create an arrangement. But because nobody came to inherit it after a long time, the heavenly crystal eagle nest was not opened, the egg died eventually after a long time.\n\nThe second possibility was that the heavenly eagle egg had no life force left because Hei Fan did it. This egg was not truly dead, it needed a special method to unseal it.\n\nIf it was the first possibility, Fang Yuan naturally could not obtain any benefits. He could only get a heavenly crystal eagle nest and a dead immemorial egg. They had great value in themselves but that was all.\n\nFrom Fang Yuan’s perspective, he would naturally prefer the second possibility.\n\nBut if that was the case, what was the special method that could unseal the egg?\n\n“Assuming the second case, how can I unseal this dead egg, to let it regain life force and even hatch?” Fang Yuan fell into deep thought.\n\nHe thought for a long time, but there were no answers.\n\nIt was not strange.\n\nThis egg was quite literally dead. If not for that, Fang Yuan would not have confirmed this at the start so easily.\n\n“If I were Hei Fan, I would definitely leave behind clues to resolve this problem after setting up this dead egg, so that descendants could inherit this.” Fang Yuan had a flash of inspiration.\n\nHe realized he had subconsciously ignored something.\n\nIt was the refinement path methods that Hei Fan had once modified and left behind on purpose.\n\n“I used these methods to open the heavenly crystal eagle nest. If I use these methods again, will it work on the dead egg?” Fang Yuan had a bold assumption.\n\nBut he did not act yet.\n\nBecause this was just a hypothesis, there was no proof or evidence backing it.\n\nFang Yuan was vigilant, he started using wisdom path methods, he went deep into analyzing these refinement path methods, placing focus on deducing them.\n\nHe quickly discovered something strange.\n\nWhat was strange?\n\nSome refinement path killer moves were very strangely modified. The original versions were better and had stronger effects than the newer versions.\n\nHei Fan’s modifications were simply going the reverse direction.\n\nWhat was he trying to do?\n\nFang Yuan suddenly thought about some historical records regarding Hei Fan that were inside Hei Cheng’s memories.\n\nHei Fan was a rank eight Gu Immortal, during his later years, he liked to nurture juniors, but he often taught them: “When learning, you have to think for yourself, don’t just blindly follow and idolize your seniors’ experiences. Only by thinking for yourself and learning them can you go further on the path of a Gu Immortal.”\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan looked at the refinement path killer moves with new ideas.\n\nHe tried to remove the ‘failed modifications’ that Hei Fan did in those killer moves, he made a shocking discovery.\n\n“So these refinement path killer moves are not failures, by combining them, they form a brand new killer move!”\n\n“Hei Fan had purposely added in unnecessary steps in these refinement path killer moves, they are failures individually. But together, these parts can combine into a whole!”\n\nWhat made Fang Yuan more surprised was that this new killer move was a type of blood path method.\n\nThe great rank eight time path Hei Fan, researching blood path?\n\nThis was not strange.\n\nEver since Blood Sea Ancestor appeared, blood path’s power was known to all. All the super forces restricted the growth of blood path, while researching it secretly themselves.\n\nThis was something happening even in Central Continent’s ten great ancient sects, not to mention Northern Plains, a region with Gu Immortals that sought battle strength greatly.\n\nFang Yuan was much more confident in blood path than refinement path.\n\nHe was a blood path grandmaster! Blood path was his most used path in the past.\n\nWith some research, Fang Yuan realized: Hei Fan had purposely concealed this blood refinement killer move, it was to be used on the upper extreme heavenly eagle!\n\nBut this blood refinement killer move was not complete.\n\nWith Fang Yuan’s knowledge and blood path attainment, he could tell that this blood path killer move was not complete, it was only a portion.\n\nSeeing this, Fang Yuan was not disappointed, instead his eyes were shining brightly.\n\n“Hei Fan must have the complete blood refinement killer move, he used the first half to process this upper extreme heavenly eagle dead egg. He only left the other half to his descendants.”\n\n“But he did not pass down this blood path killer move directly to his descendants, he used a unique method to conceal it.”\n\n“His first motive must be to test his descendants, so that a skilled Gu Immortal who could think for themselves inherits this. The second reason was that blood path was notorious, if the great Hei Fan’s true inheritance used a blood path method, it would cause a huge commotion. Hei Fan did not want that to happen.”\n\nFang Yuan was scheming and shrewd, he could easily tell what Hei Fan was thinking in the past.\n\nAfter clarifying this, he was even more assured that this upper extreme heavenly eagle was not truly dead, it was just processed by Hei Fan through a special method.\n\nThat made things easier!\n\nFang Yuan was no longer an immortal zombie, he could easily draw blood from his own body.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to use blood refinement, he stopped his actions.\n\n“So close! I almost failed to notice Hei Fan’s intention…” Fang Yuan’s forehead was filled with sweat.\n\nWhy did Hei Fan leave a blood path method for his descendants?\n\nWasn’t it really strange?\n\nEveryone knew that Hei Fan was a time path great expert, at this level, he could easily use time path methods to leave his inheritance behind and imitate methods of other paths.\n\nBut he used blood path instead of his strongest time path, why was that?\n\nThere was only one possible reason, the blood path method could do something that time path could not.\n\nWhat else could it be?\n\nAs a blood path grandmaster, Fang Yuan first thought of — bloodline recognition!\n\nThe inheritance that Hei Fan left behind was meant for Hei tribe descendants. The inheritance of a super force’s Gu Immortal was usually kept to the clan or tribe itself, the first condition was to be blood related. Very few Gu Immortals would leave behind inheritances that could be obtained by others.\n\nAttitude Gu, the refinement path method left behind for generations, they were just the first two precautions.\n\nThe blood refinement method that uses one’s bloodline was the third.\n\n“If the inheritor is not a Hei tribe descendant and does not have Hei tribe’s bloodline, then blood refining this dead egg might cause a backlash. Or rather, the immemorial desolate beast upper extreme heavenly eagle that hatches would be the enemy of this Gu Immortal!”\n\nFang Yuan thought of this and felt even more sweat on his forehead.\n\nEspecially the last part, if he truly became enemies with an immemorial desolate beast, of rank eight battle strength, he would be in deep trouble!\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle was very fast, Fang Yuan could not outrun it, he had weak defenses as well, he would definitely die.\n\n“It seems that I can only use a proper bloodline to refine the egg.” Fang Yuan wisely stopped.\n\nSome days later.\n\nIn a part of the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nHei Cheng’s hair was a mess, he had a very tired and weak expression.\n\nFang Yuan manipulated the strength path immortal zombie, flying towards him.\n\nHei Cheng jolted like he was hit by lightning, his body shook as he shouted in fear and shock: “You, what do you want?!”\n\nEarlier, Fang Yuan had soul searched him, forget about that. Now, he was using all sorts of methods to ‘torture’ Hei Cheng, he was truly in misery, he felt that he was better off dead.\n\nHei Cheng was Fang Yuan’s captive, at this stage, he had already given up. His Gu Immortal demeanor was gone.\n\nBut he could not even bite his own tongue to suicide.\n\nFang Yuan had thought: Hei Cheng still had some value, even though Hei tribe was gone, Hei Lou Lan was alive.\n\nThus, Hei Cheng was in a state where he could neither die nor live in peace.\n\n“Don’t worry, this is likely to be the last time, I am confident of it.” Fang Yuan manipulated the strength path immortal zombie, smiling as he got closer.\n\nHei Cheng was about to cry, he struggled intensely: “You say that every time, it is always the last time! No, no, no! Ah—!”"
