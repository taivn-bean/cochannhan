Why!\n\nWhy was this Gu worm carcass not in his hands but in his opponent’s hands?\n\nThe yellow scaled merman could not understand.\n\n“Is this all an illusion?” He was going crazy, his pale face surged with redness.\n\nHe suddenly pointed at Xia Lin as he screamed in a shrill voice: “You cheated!”\n\nThe mermaid girl Xia Lin heard this and became enraged.\n\nShe was also kept in the dark, not knowing of Fang Yuan’s methods, she shouted: “You lost fair and square, are you going to deny that in front of everyone?”\n\nThe yellow scaled merman looked at Xia Lin and the surrounding Gu Masters, his gaze became hollow as he muttered: “No, this is not real, everything is fake, this is an illusion.”\n\nHe stumbled back and wanted to run away from this cruel reality.\n\nLooking at his pitiful demeanor, the surrounding Gu Masters had complex expressions, they looked at Xia Lin with trepidation and wariness.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman was almost mentally broken by Fang Yuan!\n\nXia Lin pursued: “Let’s transact, you did not win a single round, this Golden Jade House is mine.”\n\nThe yellow scaled merman shuddered like he was shocked with lightning, he screamed in response: “No, this is mine, this is my foundation, I will not give it to anyone! Don’t even think about it, you can have it over my dead body!!”\n\n“Sir, we can force them to go down with us!” The scarred merman came up and said with a sinister expression.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman shook again.\n\nHe wanted to do that, but hearing these words, he realized something.\n\n“No matter who it is, this mermaid girl is just a pawn. The other party could manipulate this situation remotely, setting up a trap against me that I could not deal with. How can I face someone of such a magnitude? If I fight now, wouldn’t I be courting death?”\n\n_2_The yellow scaled merman did not want to give up his Golden Jade House, but compared to his life, the latter was more important.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman looked around him, instincts told him that the enemy was among this crowd.\n\nHe felt suspicious of everyone, but he could not confirm their identity.\n\n“I admit my loss, I lose!” Suddenly, he stopped his methods as he sprawled on the ground like a dying fish, shouting loudly.\n\nHe prostrated on the ground, admitting: “No matter who you are, I admit my defeat, is that enough? You can do anything with me, but before that, may you please enlighten me, when did I offend you?”\n\nEveryone went into a clamor.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman’s actions were unexpected, some people snorted in disdain, some felt that he was able to put down his pride and was quite a formidable person.\n\nAn unscrupulous merchant that had been in power for decades was naturally not so simple.\n\nXia Lin was also dazed, at the same time, she felt deep admiration towards Master Chu.\n\nShe understood clearly that this was all due to Master Chu, without his guidance, Xia Lin would be in even deeper trouble than the yellow scaled merman. But looking at the prostrating yellow scaled merman, Xia Lin felt joyful and also relieved.\n\n“It is time.” Fang Yuan smiled, guiding Xia Lin.\n\nXia Lin spoke to the yellow scaled merman: “Do you know why you lost?”\n\nSeeing her speak, the crowd went silent.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman raised his head, looking at Xia Lin: “I do not know, please enlighten me.”\n\n“Because someone wanted you to lose.” Xia Lin stated an obvious fact.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman’s heart jumped, he lowered his head: “I understand, I understand.”\n\nXia Lin added: “Do you want this Golden Jade House back?”\n\n“What?” The yellow scaled merman was stunned, what did she mean? Of course he wanted it back, but he did not know about the other party, what did they mean by that? Were they toying with him or had ulterior motives?”\n\nXia Lin continued: “I have a condition before I return it to you.”\n\nThe yellow scaled merman started to kowtow: “Revered lady, please tell me.”\n\nXia Lin looked at the yellow scaled merman as she said slowly: “The reason why you ended up like this was because of just desserts, you committed too many sins. From now on, you have to commit acts of kindness, do good deeds and turn over a new leaf, I will let you off and return this Golden Jade House. But remember, if you return to your old ways, we will take not just this Golden Jade House next time.”\n\nOnce she said that, all the Gu Masters showed perplexed expressions.\n\nAfter so much talk, Xia Lin and her backer actually had such intentions?\n\nThey were promoting kindness?\n\nThis was not a common thing.\n\nThe yellow scaled merman was also surprised but he did not dare to show anything on the surface, he quickly thanked her profusely: “I will change, I will definitely turn over a new leaf. Revered lady, you are the benefactor of my life, you changed my ways. You are like a saintess guiding people towards kindness and away from evil. I was wrong, I was really wrong, thank you, Saintess, for giving me this chance, from now on, I will be a good person and dedicate my life to doing good deeds!”\n\nThe yellow scaled merman lowered his head and apologized sincerely, he was like a pitiful child.\n\nXia Lin’s face flushed: “I am not the saintess, I have no qualification to be one, don’t spout nonsense. Remember your promise, we will be watching you. If we find out or anyone reports you in the future, you will regret it.”\n\nSaying so, Xia Lin turned around and left.\n\nThe surrounding Gu Masters left a path for her.\n\nXia Lin had just left the Golden Jade House when she suddenly vanished without a trace.\n\nAt the next moment, she appeared at the edge of the island through Fang Yuan’s teleportation.\n\n“It’s safe here, you can go back now.” Fang Yuan did not show up, he only transmitted his voice.\n\n“Master Chu, you saved me again, how can I repay you?” Xia Lin called out in her mind: “Master Chu? Master Chu…”\n\n“We will meet again if we are fated to.” Fang Yuan said as he smiled, memories emerging in his mind again.\n\nOn the beach, Fang Yuan chased after Xie Han Mo and the rest who were leaving: “Please wait!”\n\nXie Han Mo and the rest stopped walking, while the two guards stared at Fang Yuan in annoyance.\n\n“Lad, stop following us.”\n\n“If you want to repay the debt of gratitude, you should get away from us. Do you know that Saintess could have stayed hidden this time, but to save you, she showed up. Now, we failed to find any evidence and even made the other party alert.”\n\n“I know!” Fang Yuan was panting.\n\n“You know nothing.” The blue scaled guard rolled his eyes.\n\nFang Yuan chuckled, raising his head and looking at Xie Han Mo and the guards: “I was too rash, but after that, I understand now. You are the Merman Imperial Court’s current generation saintess, you came here to find evidence of Frost Tide tribe’s corruption. I can help you in this matter. Because I operated gambling dens before, I know about their workings. The main avenue for this Frost Tide tribe’s money laundering has to be that gambling den earlier.”\n\n“Please give me a chance saintess, let me repay the debt of saving my life.”\n\nBoth guards hesitated, they looked at Xie Han Mo.\n\nXie Han Mo’s thick eyelashes drooped down, before she opened her eyes and looked at Fang Yuan with a crystal clear gaze, after three breaths of time, she nodded: “Then I will thank you in advance, human Gu Master. What is your name?”\n\n“My name is Gu Yue Fang Yuan. You can call me Fang Yuan.” Fang Yuan laughed heartily."
