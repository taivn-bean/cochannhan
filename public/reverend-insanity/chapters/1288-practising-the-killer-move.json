And because he was unwilling to give up, Old Ancestor Xue Hu and Mao Li Qiu were expending their energy to attack Reverse Flow River, in order to kill Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the river water, thinking: “At this rate, I still have a lot of time.”\n\nHis heart eased slightly.\n\nReverse Flow River was a secluded domain of heaven and earth indeed, it endured the attacks of two rank eight existences, only falling a little in water level.\n\nOf course, a reason was that Xue Hu and Mao Li Qiu did not use their full strength.\n\nThey were wary of each other, and Wei Ling Yang and Bi Chen Tian were together with the other Central Continent Gu Immortals, awaiting their chance. These people restrained each other, they guarded against each other, how could they use their full strength on Fang Yuan?\n\nBecause of this complex situation, a lot of pressure was lifted off Fang Yuan, he could test his killer move without rushing.\n\nThe first activation.\n\nFang Yuan was careful.\n\nFirst was perseverance Immortal Gu, it had been expending red date immortal essence to allow Fang Yuan to move freely in Reverse Flow River, remaining unrestricted by the secluded domain of heaven and earth.\n\nNext were a large number of water path mortal Gu, they flew up in Fang Yuan’s immortal aperture, surrounding the huge perseverance Immortal Gu as they moved in the air.\n\nSoon, large amounts of water vapor rose, as faint blue light appeared in them.\n\nBut soon, this blue light vanished, some of it had even turned red, the originally ice-cold water vapor had turned warmer.\n\n“I failed.” Fang Yuan immediately stopped.\n\nThe scene in front of him was out of his expectations.\n\nThis was not what he wanted.\n\nHe stopped his immortal essence expenditure, crack crack, large numbers of water path mortal Gu exploded, destroyed on the spot.\n\nFang Yuan calmed down and started to think.\n\nAccording to his planning, there should be blue light shining as the water vapor became colder, why was there red light and warmer temperature?\n\nFang Yuan deduced in his mind, soon, because of his wisdom path attainment level, he found the source of the problem.\n\nIt was because he had used two conflicting water path mortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan immediately changed one of them, in Reverse Flow River, he could open his immortal aperture and connect to treasure yellow heaven to purchase water path mortal Gu easily.\n\nAfter modifying the entire immortal killer move, Fang Yuan tried to activate it again for the second time.\n\nPerseverance Immortal Gu was still in use.\n\nThe surrounding water path mortal Gu started to rise and fly around it.\n\nFirst was water vapor and blue light, he soon passed this stage as Fang Yuan used Immortal Gu Pulling Water.\n\nRank six strength path Immortal Gu Pulling Water.\n\nThis was the second core of the immortal killer move.\n\nThe first core was undeniably rank seven perseverance Immortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan was careful.\n\nWhile activating perseverance Immortal Gu, he activated Pulling Water, it was a very risky thing.\n\nIf he could not manage it well, these two Immortal Gu might interfere and cause harm to each other, they might even get destroyed.\n\nTesting immortal killer moves was not just risky to the Gu Immortal, the Immortal Gu and mortal Gu involved were also in danger. And because Immortal Gu themselves were fragments of the Great Dao, when they suffered a backlash, the damage was much more severe.\n\nFang Yuan was very vigilant, he was quickly rewarded for it.\n\nHe met with difficulty.\n\nAlthough pulling water Immortal Gu was activated and its mystical power was used, it could not integrate into the framework of the move.\n\n“What is the problem?”\n\nFang Yuan stopped.\n\nA lot of water path mortal Gu were destroyed.\n\nExperimenting with immortal killer moves had a price.\n\nA complete and effective immortal killer move needed conceptualization and experimentation, the Gu Immortal needed to put in a lot of effort and resources.\n\nAs the attacks in the outside world continued, Fang Yuan ignored them, he had the sovereign immortal body, his thoughts were produced rapidly as they moved around and collided.\n\nWith his wisdom path grandmaster attainment level, wisdom path dao marks, as well as wisdom path methods, his deductions were progressing rapidly.\n\nIt was faster this time!\n\nIn just a few breaths of time, Fang Yuan found the problem.\n\nThe powers of perseverance Immortal Gu and pulling water Immortal Gu could not fuse together, it was because the quantity and types of water path mortal Gu were not appropriate. These mortal Gu were the bridge between the two Immortal Gu, they had the effect of linking them.\n\nFang Yuan thought about it, he reduced a portion of some water path mortal Gu and while increasing others, at the same time, he added in new water path mortal Gu.\n\nThe third activation.\n\nThis time, it was smooth sailing, he successfully fused pulling water Immortal Gu into the killer move.\n\nThe moment he succeeded, there were waves forming in the Reverse Flow River water below him.\n\nIt was finally starting to work!\n\nBut he was still far from reaching his goal.\n\nFang Yuan did not rest, he could not waste time in this situation, he continued experimenting, activating the immortal killer move, his aura strengthened and weakened at times, flickering continuously.\n\n“What is Liu Guan Yi doing?”\n\n“Gu worm auras are appearing on his body from time to time, it looks like he is experimenting with an immortal killer move?”\n\nOther than Old Ancestor Xue Hu and Mao Li Qiu, the other Gu Immortals were just watching.\n\nEvery time Fang Yuan experimented with his immortal killer move, the Gu worm auras would leak, it could not be concealed from the Gu Immortals.\n\nIf he wanted to conceal the auras, he needed a special immortal killer move.\n\nThese types of immortal killer moves were very rare, like Fang Yuan’s dark assassination, it was among these immortal killer moves.\n\nFang Yuan reached his limits in conceptualized myriad self second style, he could not consider adding aura concealment to it.\n\nBut it did not matter.\n\nGu worm auras alone could not determine the types of Gu worms.\n\nFurthermore, he had just created myriad self second style, it was complex and used many different Gu, it was not possible for them to find out its flaws by watching.\n\nFourth time, fifth time…\n\nFang Yuan continued to activate the immortal killer move, sometimes he made great progress, while sometimes, because of some adjustments, he backtracked by several steps.\n\nFang Yuan was not dejected, he persevered on without any expression.\n\n“He is really testing an immortal killer move.”\n\n“Hehehe, is this Liu Guan Yi an idiot? Creating an immortal killer move on the spot, does he think he is an Immortal Venerable or Demon Venerable?”\n\n“Even if he creates an immortal killer move, I want to see if he can use it to deal with all of us?”\n\nThe Gu Immortals watching all commented on Fang Yuan’s naivety and mocked him in disdain.\n\nIf immortal killer moves were so easy to create, would they still be immortal killer moves?\n\nBut soon, some of their expressions changed.\n\nThey found that some mystical changes were occurring in Reverse Flow River.\n\n“Twenty-first try.”\n\nFang Yuan stretched out his arm, grabbing towards at river below his feet.\n\n“Rise.” At the same time, he muttered lightly.\n\nBam.\n\nA soft sound occurred as a huge ball appeared on the river surface near him.\n\nThis ball was completely made of Reverse Flow River’s water, after rising, it burst as water splattered everywhere.\n\nThe killer move activation failed!\n\nFang Yuan’s nose was bleeding as two streams of blood flowed down.\n\n“His immortal killer move has effect on Reverse Flow River?” Yu Yi Ye Zi saw this and his eyes shined with sharp light.\n\n“No, more accurately speaking, he is using Reverse Flow River to create an immortal killer move!” Bu Zhen Zi said.\n\n“Hmph, laughable.” Black Extremity smiled coldly: “Back then, I used Reverse Flow River to create the sub and main fate reversing refinement formation, it used up several years of my time. Liu Guan Yi, even if you are the Reverse Flow River Lord, you are simply too arrogant, you think you can create an immortal killer move using it in such a short amount of time?”\n\nEvidently, none of the Gu Immortals here thought highly of Fang Yuan’s chances.\n\nBut soon, Fang Yuan started his testing again.\n\nPew!\n\nThis time, a small mound appeared on the river surface near him.\n\nThe mound quickly collapsed as the water doused Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression turned pale, his body wavered, not only did he have a nosebleed, even his ears were bleeding.\n\n“I failed again, Man as Before!” At the next moment, he was completely healed.\n\n“I should find the reason for the failure. It seems that a small problem occurred at the final juncture…” Fang Yuan fell into deep contemplation."
