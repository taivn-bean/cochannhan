After becoming rank nine, the calamities and tribulations would become even more terrifying.\n\nVenerables faced a grand tribulation every ten years, a myriad tribulation every fifty years, and a chaotic disaster every one hundred years!\n\nThis chaotic disaster originated from the chaos outside the world boundary.\n\nEach time it arrived, the venerable’s life would be in danger, they had to use their full strength to fight for a chance of survival.\n\nOrdinary Gu Immortals did not know this, but all the past venerables had gone through these terrifying chaotic disasters, they knew about the terror of this tribulation.\n\nAnd now, Limitless Demon Venerable tested it with his own body, without even using any defensive methods, he resisted the chaos and returned unharmed!!!\n\nThis scene was a huge shock to the present venerables.\n\nAs for people like Fang Yuan who knew the details while not having experienced them personally, his shock was not as great as the venerables.\n\n“You did it.” A while later, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable sighed deeply and said.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable remained silent.\n\n“No, he hasn’t. This is not true eternal life yet!” Paradise Earth suddenly spoke, he had a tone and expression of certainty.\n\nEveryone looked towards him.\n\n“Indeed, I have not. This is not considered eternal life.” At the next moment, Limitless Demon Venerable agreed with the words as he showed an expression of dejectedness.\n\nNext, he made a shocking move.\n\nHe opened his mouth towards the hole of the world boundary and started to suck in.\n\nA large amount of chaos was sucked into Limitless Demon Venerable’s stomach!\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable watched with contracted pupils, they could not help but take in a deep breath.\n\nIf a venerable was considered a child, the chaos would be fire. earlier, when Limitless Demon Venerable placed his hand into the chaos, he was roasting his flesh with the fire. But now, he was even more daring, he was swallowing fire!\n\nAfter Limitless Demon Venerable sucked in a large amount of chaos, he sat down in a cross-legged fashion.\n\nAt the same time, chaos seeped out of the hole and rushed towards his head, shoulders, and body like a flowing river.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable activated his killer move for the first time, an immensely strong aura burst out and shook the minds of all the immortals present.\n\nEveryone watched silently, they knew that Limitless Demon Venerable was currently giving it a try.\n\nThis was an advancement!\n\nHe was trying to advance to the true realm of eternal life!!\n\nEver since he was a child, he had maintained a heart of curiosity.\n\nHe was like an innocent child who was filled with desire to explore the unknown.\n\nHe wanted to know everything, he wanted to know the truth.\n\nHe did not pursue fame or fortune, the status of a venerable did not make him feel any pride or arrogance.\n\nHe had once reached the peak of the world, the end of heaven and earth.\n\nBut he still wanted to continue moving!\n\nYet, there was no road ahead of him.\n\nThus, he planned meticulously and worked with Star Constellation, dragging the entire Gu cultivation world along with his dangerous plan of creating the Crazed Demon formation, he prepared for a million years just for this moment.\n\nAll of it was to pursue the truth!\n\nNo road remained ahead of him.\n\nThus, he moved his legs and exerted all his strength to step into the boundless darkness.\n\nHe wanted to carve out his own road!\n\nThis was the final push.\n\nLimitless was doing his best!\n\nA long time passed, but it felt like an instant.\n\nWhoosh.\n\nBlack fire started to spew out of Limitless Demon Venerable’s nose and ears.\n\nThe immortals’ hearts shook.\n\nNext, Limitless Demon Venerable opened his eyes slowly and looked at the immortals, saying plainly: “I failed.”\n\n“No! I am still around.” Demon Immortal Qi Jue shouted and made his move, using all his strength to activate practice Gu.\n\nA wave of profound light shot towards Limitless Demon Venerable’s body from Demon Immortal Qi Jue.\n\nThe black fire on Limitless Demon Venerable was quickly extinguished!\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable gained some time to rest, he laughed loudly and shook his head: “Qi Jue, you can stop now.”\n\n“How can we determine the result before putting in all our effort?” Demon Immortal Qi Jue rebuked in anger, “Are you willing to give up like this? The true eternal life… I want, I want to see it too!”\n\nDemon Venerable sighed, a complex expression could be seen on his face: “I failed even after a million years of accumulation. Don’t you get it? Eternal life — does not exist.”\n\nAt the next moment.\n\nBam.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable shattered abruptly, turning back into countless fragments of truthful floating ice.\n\n“No!!” Secret Schemer and Not Immortal screamed in unison, grieving like they had lost their loved one.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable failed!\n\nBecause Demon Immortal Qi Jue had too close of a connection with him, the chaos instantly approached him, as it swept past him, he vanished without a trace!\n\nThe great pseudo venerable did not even manage to last three breaths of time.\n\nThe power of the terrifying chaotic disaster was evident with one glance!\n\nThe immortals were still in a daze.\n\nThis battle in Crazed Demon Cave that took a million years of accumulation and also all the venerables’ planning ended like this?\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable revived, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable also revived, Paradise Earth changed to cultivating heaven path, while Spectral Soul Demon Venerable lost his reasoning. In the end, Limitless Demon Venerable suppressed everyone in strength, but he still failed to succeed.\n\nHe died, he died on the road of exploration.\n\nEternal life?\n\nIt was a mere dream.\n\nThere was nothing!\n\nIt did not exist!!\n\n“How could he fail? How could he fail!” Not Immortal shouted.\n\nSecret Schemer held his head and muttered dejectedly: “There is no eternal life… hehe, there is no eternal life… hehe.”\n\nHe had gone insane!\n\n“Does eternal life really not exist in this world? Venerable is the limit, there is no… road ahead?” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable muttered to herself.\n\nShe had asked the question that all the immortals were wondering!\n\nBut nobody could answer it.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable might be the most qualified in this aspect, since he had already surpassed everyone else by a huge margin.\n\nBut he had died.\n\nIt failed.\n\nHe died from the chaotic disaster.\n\nUsing his life, it seemed like he exposed a cruel truth to the immortals.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nRight at this moment, the sound of wind could be heard.\n\nFang Yuan suddenly made his move, snatching a piece of the truthful floating ice!\n\nThe immortals were instantly jolted awake.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable died and turned into pieces of truthful floating ice.\n\nMost of the truthful floating ice had been destroyed in the chaos, but a small portion remained.\n\nThe chaos… could not do anything to them!\n\nThey were the eternal life results derived by Limitless’ Crazed Demon formation, they were definitely the essence of his hard work!!\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable died, but his million years of hard work had not gone down the drain, he left behind abundant results!\n\nSnatch them!!\n\nThere was nothing else to say, after the immortals reacted, they attacked almost at the same time.\n\nRumble…\n\nA large number of killer moves were activated, colliding into each other and exploding loudly.\n\nHeaven shook and the earth cracked!\n\nNot Immortal and Secret Schemer did not even manage to make a sound before they died on the spot.\n\nBut the remaining pieces of the truthful floating ice were intact and still shining radiantly!\n\nThis was expected.\n\nEven the chaotic disaster could do nothing to them, venerables and pseudo venerables were also unable to damage them with their killer moves.\n\nRumble…\n\nThe scene was chaotic, killer moves influenced each other as the immortals restrained one another.\n\n“Get lost!!”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable shouted angrily, golden light surged in the sky, exploding fiercely like a crashing tsunami, everywhere it went, nothing could stop it.\n\nFang Yuan and the other pseudo venerables quickly dodged.\n\nThe golden aurora light suddenly turned into a spiral that sucked in a piece of the truthful floating ice.\n\nSeeing this, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable snorted coldly and scattered some flying stars, hundreds or thousands of them radiated with starlight and crashed into the golden aurora, getting mutually destroyed.\n\nAs Giant Sun Immortal Venerable did not succeed, the truthful floating ice that was taken by the golden aurora was free again, it floated freely in the void.\n\nThis was the largest truthful floating ice, all of the remaining truthful floating ice fragments were merely its size after being added up. Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was attempting to take away half of this eternal life result that took a million years to nurture, how could that happen? Star Constellation Immortal Venerable would not allow him to succeed!\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s gazes were locked onto each other.\n\nRight at this time, Lu Wei Yin suddenly made a move, targeting the small truthful floating ice fragment that was closest to him.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable did not move, but starlight appeared out of nowhere, sending Lu Wei Yin flying.\n\nAt almost the same time, Fang Yuan was also stopped by Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\nHe wanted to target the other truthful floating ices but golden light shot down like needles, almost piercing his body.\n\nThe two venerables opposed each other, but they held the same attitude towards Fang Yuan and the rest.\n\nBe it Star Constellation Immortal Venerable or Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, they were very domineering, they did not want the truthful floating ice to end up with anyone else.\n\nLu Wei Yin and Fang Yuan were obstructed, at this time, the pseudo venerables had to prepare and wait for another moment to arise when the two venerables fought again.\n\nThe hole was gradually expanding.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable had already died. Before he died, he was able to suppress the tiny hole.\n\nBut after his death, the power he left behind was weakening, even though chaos did not seep out of the hole in the world boundary anymore, that was going to happen soon.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable took a look at the hole in the world boundary, he spoke calmly to Star Constellation Immortal Venerable: “Star Constellation, why don’t we have a ceasefire again and deal with these pseudo venerables first. We can then fix the world boundary’s hole and split the truthful floating ice between ourselves. How’s that?”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable nodded and replied to him with her direct actions.\n\nImmediately, starlight danced around and shot everywhere, launching fatal attacks towards Fang Yuan and the other pseudo venerables.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable’s killer move soon followed.\n\nFang Yuan and the rest had to dodge everywhere, they escaped in distress.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable died and the Crazed Demon formation was destroyed, without Limitless’ retaliation method, the two venerables were free to attack.\n\nOf course, they did not use their full strength, even in the current situation. The reason was that they were guarding against each other.\n\nEven so, Fang Yuan and the rest were in dangerous situations, they were often struggling in the face of death.\n\n“I can’t continue resisting these two venerables’ power. Everyone, I’m leaving first.” Fang Yuan shouted and dragged Qi Sea Ancestor along, wanting to leave the ninth layer.\n\nParadise Earth frowned immediately.\n\nCrazed Demon Cave only had the ninth layer left now, if Fang Yuan left, the two venerables would not have the opportunity to chase him.\n\nBecause anyone who left would be giving the other venerable a chance.\n\nIt meant giving up the snatching of the truthful floating ice!\n\nBecause next, as long as either venerable made a move to seal the ninth layer of Crazed Demon Cave, the pseudo venerables would have trouble trying to come in again after they leave.\n\nAs long as they stalled for some time, the two venerables would be able to keep away the truthful floating ice, after that, they would be able to easily deal with the pseudo venerables!\n\nBut right at this moment, the two venerables snorted coldly together.\n\n“Others can leave, but you, Fang Yuan, cannot!”\n\n“Please leave behind the truthful floating ice that you snatched away earlier, you cannot bring this away with you.”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable spoke one sentence each, expressing their honest attitude.\n\nAmong the Gu Immortals, Fang Yuan was the first to get a piece. Everyone else including the two venerables had not obtained anything yet.\n\nAnd Fang Yuan’s piece was quite big too, it was at least ten percent of the entire truthful floating ice!\n\nAt this moment, the two venerables cooperated again, dealing with Fang Yuan together.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression changed.\n\nEarlier, the two venerables worked together to deal with him, but the pressure now was incomparable to before.\n\nSoon, Fang Yuan was forced to activate reverse flow protection seal again!\n\nReverse Flow River was nearly depleted earlier, but after it was replenished during this period of time, the river water had risen slightly in sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s killer moves were quickly reflected back to them.\n\nHowever, for these two venerables, reverse flow protection seal was only a slight bother, it was a mere obstacle.\n\nAs long as they used skillful methods, they would be able to resolve it in some time."
