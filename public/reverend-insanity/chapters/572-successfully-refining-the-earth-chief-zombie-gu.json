He also deciphered the clues of my inheritance and refined the Immortal Gu, he was not only fated but also had extraordinary methods. Even more importantly, he knows to bow and submit, when he knows that things cannot always go his way, he immediately compromises, this person is extremely shrewd as well! What is his origin?”\n\nMo Yao’s will could not help but wonder about that question.\n\nShe had just recently come out of Water Pavilion and resided in Fang Yuan’s mind; she had analyzed many of Fang Yuan’s thoughts and immediately learned many of his secrets.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan’s response was quick and immediately took preventive measures, making her progress slow down greatly.\n\nThus, Mo Yao’s will learnt of Fang Yuan’s secrets but what she knew was limited.\n\nAmong them included the secrets Fang Yuan revealed to her of his own accord.\n\nShe still did not know that Fang Yuan possessed Spring Autumn Cicada, thus she had no way of knowing Fang Yuan’s biggest secret of being a transmigrator.\n\nThis was the world of Gu.\n\nMo Yao had already perished and what was left was only a portion of her will. Unable to use Gu worms, Mo Yao’s will could only take advantage of Fang Yuan’s low attainment in wisdom path.\n\n“I had just recently awakened, I do not know what his background is. This young man has absurdly firm willpower and is extremely opinionated. I should just bide my time and guide him to return Water Pavilion to the sect first. It will not be too late to persuade him to do good once we arrive at Spirit Affinity House…”\n\nMo Yao’s will had inherited some intelligence of the main body and immediately kept quiet when she realized any persuasion would be in vain.\n\nThere was no resistance at all; Fang Yuan’s dark and eerie gaze slowly retracted, closing his eyes to rest on the wolf’s back.\n\nHe was not someone who slaughtered willfully.\n\nThere was a reason for letting the wolves massacre at full force today.\n\nOne was to attract the earth chief beast groups underground. earth chief beast was a wild beast, the thick smell of blood would attract and stimulate their savage nature, making them risk emerging from the ground.\n\nSecond was that the massacre would produce large numbers of souls. Since the start of the Imperial Court contest, Fang Yuan had been using soul burial toad to collect the souls. He had Dang Hun mountain, and as long as Dang Hun mountain did not die completely, the more souls he had, the better it was for him.\n\nThird reason was aimed at Mo Yao’s will in his mind, he was trying to probe her.\n\nAs for the nasty repercussions from wantonly killing Gu Masters, Fang Yuan was happy instead of afraid.\n\nNot mentioning that he had already made a public announcement, making the consequences clear to everyone, even if the public stirs and the resentment and hatred towards him rises, so what?\n\nHe was at the peak of mortals, the famous Wolf King Chang Shan Yin! He was no longer the minor character several years ago who had to act cautiously.\n\nIn this Imperial Court blessed land where Gu Immortals could not enter, his one shout could cause countless Gu Masters to tremble. His stomp could shake the sacred palace. With one thought, the wolf groups would instantly create a bloodbath.\n\nThere was a famous saying on Earth — Political power comes from military strength.\n\nA strong fist is power and power is the truth!\n\nBut on Earth, power was concentrated in the masses. Besides violence and fists, one needed to use righteousness to conceal the truth and compromise according to the public sentiment.\n\nBut here, individual strength was far above the group. Public sentiment and righteousness were much weaker. Not mentioning anyone else, just take the current Fang Yuan as an example — who cares about your dogshit hatred and grudges, whoever comes will face decimation! Whoever is not pleasing to the eyes, they can be slaughtered with no care at all!\n\nLooking disdainfully at all lives, trampling on the public sentiment, without restraints and free like the wind!\n\nBut in Fang Yuan’s pursuit of the Great Dao, he had no interest towards casually slaughtering ants. Today’s large scale massacre was no more than a small step towards his majestic target.\n\nAs he thought of this trip’s goal, Fang Yuan slowly opened his eyes.\n\nHowl!\n\nA beast roar echoed to the skies.\n\nA mound bulged up from a distance before bursting open; mud and stones splattered around as a fifty feet tall earth chief myriad beast king jumped out.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes flashed with a chilly light as he sneered: “You shall be the one.”\n\nAt once, he commanded the wolf group to attack, endless thoughts flew about in his mind like an endless drizzle.\n\nIf one looked from a high altitude, one would see an extremely spectacular scene of innumerable wolves rushing forward like an endless tide.\n\nAs they neared the earth chief myriad beast king, the wolves suddenly split into several groups like ants trying to climb up an elephant. At the same time, azure wolves howled and flew down, spiralling around earth chief myriad beast king like birds.\n\nEarth chief myriad beast king jumped towards the wolf group and started rampaging, soon, wolf blood splattered and wolf corpses covered the ground. Its giant legs would leave behind terrifying blood pits in its trail.\n\nFang Yuan had a smile as he observed the battle from the skies.\n\nUnder his control, the wolf groups advanced and retreated, sometimes slowly and sometimes fast, as they charged forward waves after waves, forming a situation of ants devouring an elephant.\n\nEarth chief myriad beast king roared again and again while valiantly charging all around, causing large numbers of casualties in the wolf groups.\n\nIn Fang Yuan’s mind, Mo Yao gave a soft exclamation of surprise, slightly shocked at Fang Yuan’s enslavement path attainment.\n\n“Wow, I had not expected this kid to have so much talent at this young age, commanding these wolves as naturally as breathing, and with such ease like he is moving his arms, he has mastered the art of attrition battle of enslavement path, fighting the strong with a weak force, this is a master level attainment…”\n\nBut it was nothing more than a slight shock.\n\nMo Yao had seen and experienced a lot in her life and was not an ordinary Gu Immortal, but a certain generation’s fairy of Spirit Affinity House; her horizons were broad and masters as young as Fang Yuan were not few in her memory.\n\nThe battle lasted for a while, earth chief myriad beast king was roaring again and again, its energy was consumed by the wolf groups and could no longer display its fierce might…\n\nLarge numbers of earth chief beasts jumped out of the underground and joined the battle.\n\nFang Yuan chuckled indifferently, commanding the wolves with ease as he had already expected this.\n\nThe outcome of this large battle was foreordained from the start. How could a myriad beast scale earth chief beast group be his match?\n\nSuch a large battle covered a range of a thousand li, but this was ingeniously divided into dozens of sections of battle circles by Fang Yuan; using the weak wolf groups to surround and then using the strong and vigorous mutated beasts to form an arrow head that charged forward.\n\nThe first section of the battle circles was taken down by the wolf group, as they joined with the next group to destroy the second section, the third section; the dominance accumulated and the scales of victory was inclining more and more towards Fang Yuan. Finally, the wolf group’s annexing speed increased faster and faster till they butchered earth chief myriad beast king.\n\n“This kid’s enslavement path cultivation is indeed not ordinary. Although his commanding ability is exquisite and bold, using sharp and mild tactics together, he is still far away from grandmaster level attainment.” Mo Yao thought inwardly.\n\nGu Master raised, used, and refined; no matter which aspect, they were all very profound and deep.\n\nGu Masters might be using the same Gu worms, but some Gu Masters’ performance would be extremely outstanding to the point that it could be called an art. These people were known as masters!\n\nMaster could be discovered but not sought, and could not be cultivated just by investing resources. Not only did it require innate talent, the Gu Master also needed to have capability.\n\nBut above master was grandmaster.\n\nComparing master and grandmaster was like comparing grass and tree. Besides talent, aptitude and resources, grandmaster attainment also required fortuitous opportunities and comprehension.\n\nAs long as one reached grandmaster level, they could gain comprehension about any path using their own as a foundation, they could understand about yin-yang and heaven and earth, they could learn about the profoundness of the universe, surpassing the mortal realm and become immortals among immortals, sages among sages.\n\nMo Yao was a refinement path grandmaster, although she had perished, her broad vision still existed.\n\nShe had seen countless masters in her life; the main reason why she felt Fang Yuan’s attainment was impressive was because of his young age.\n\nNot long later, earth chief myriad beast king fell down loudly, having died due to the heavy injuries.\n\nBlood flowed out rapidly and soon formed into a pool of blood beside it.\n\nFang Yuan descended and personally skinned it, immediately started refining Gu next to the blood pool with wolf groups surrounding him.\n\nMo Yao’s modified earth chief zombie Gu required the freshest flesh, with the flesh of earth chief myriad beast king being the best, thousand beast king being the second best and hundred beast king being the last option.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan moved out in a large scale and personally killed the earth chief myriad beast king.\n\nThe Gu refinement continued for three days and three nights before succeeding perfectly.\n\nFang Yuan reached his goal, thereafter he dismissed majority of the wolf groups to hunt in the wild, only taking the elite mutated beasts with him as he returned back to sacred palace without stopping.\n\nThe battlefield fell into deathly stillness; suddenly, a bloody person made his way out of a hill-sized blood forest wolf corpse.\n\nThe bloody person swayed unstably as he moved and had only walked a few steps before falling down to the ground.\n\nHe gasped roughly, an incredulous look in his eyes as he muttered: “I am still alive?”\n\nHe vigorously rubbed his face, revealing his face.\n\nIt was none other than Ma Hong Yun.\n\nAfter he had been knocked unconscious by Jiang Dong, he had remained down on the ground.\n\nThat old earth chief beast king ignored him and chased after Jiang Dong.\n\nBut soon after, wolf group engulfed the area and slaughtered all living beings, and Ma Hong Yun ended up in a wolf’s mouth.\n\nIf it had been an ordinary wolf like turtleback wolf, water wolf or wind wolf, Ma Hong Yun would already have been torn into pieces and would be lying in the wolf’s stomach.\n\nFortunately, it was the hill-sized blood forest wolf that had eaten him.\n\nThis wolf opened up its large mouth and with one lap of its tongue, directly licked the ground within a hundred steps. Ma Hong Yun along with the old earth chief beast king’s corpse went down into the blood forest wolf’s stomach.\n\nIf it had continued normally, Ma Hong Yun would already have been digested by the blood forest wolf sooner or later and turn into a pile of wolf faeces.\n\nBut following the battle with the earth chief beast group, this blood forest wolf was attacked from all around and died on the battlefield; its chest and belly was torn open which allowed air to flow in.\n\nMa Hong Yun dizzily woke up and hurriedly drilled his way out. At this time, the battle had already ended and the battlefield was covered with beast corpses. Occasionally, some wild beasts that were at their final moments would gasp for air, emphasizing the deathly stillness in the surrounding.\n\nAfter Ma Hong Yun breathed enough, his strength started to gradually recover and the thick bloody odor assailed his nose.\n\nHe realized the situation was anything but reassuring: “I need to leave this place quickly, wild beasts will be attracted by the odor of the blood not long later.”\n\nMa Hong Yun had been born and raised in Northern Plains, this survival common sense was already deeply ingrained in his bones.\n\nHe immediately stood up and made sure of the direction towards sacred palace and immediately set off.\n\nBut he had just taken few steps when he stopped.\n\nHis sight was attracted by a Gu worm.\n\nThis was a wild Gu on the corpse of an earth chief beast.\n\nThe earth chief beast had died, the wild Gu on it should have perished or flown away, but this wild Gu was unexpectedly held back by a fractured bone and could not fly away.\n\n“This should be a rank two… something something Gu.” Ma Hong Yun could not remember it clearly, but it did not hinder him from knowing the value of this Gu.\n\n“Good Gu worm, this is a good Gu worm, after getting it, even if I can’t use it for myself, I can sell it for a lot of primeval stones.”\n\nMa Hong Yun felt a rush of excitement and immediately walked over, easily grabbing the Gu worm.\n\nChibiGeneral ChibiGeneral This is honestly just the start."
