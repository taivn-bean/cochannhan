With Zeng Luo Zi’s move, Miao Ming Shen observed everyone and gained quite some insight.\n\n“We have eight people, other than myself, Gui Qi Ye, Feng Jiang, and Immortal Hua Die, there are also Zeng Luo Zi, Tu Tou Tuo, Tong Hua, and Chu Ying.”\n\nOther than Zeng Luo Zi and Miao Ming Shen, Tong Hua and Tu Tou Tuo were also expressionless.\n\nThe rest had some sort of change in their expression at least.\n\nMiao Ming Shen trusted Gui Qi Ye, Feng Jiang, and Immortal Hua Die the most, but in this trip, he did not inform them about this, so their reactions were genuine.\n\nMiao Ming Shen had lots of interaction with Zeng Luo Zi, Tu Tou Tuo, and Tong Hua, he knew about their background, they were all rank seven experts that were rare in Eastern Sea.\n\nIn Eastern Sea, there was the highest number of lone immortals who are superior to those of other regions, because Eastern Sea was the most affluent in resources.\n\nMiao Ming Shen’s concern was Chu Ying. He had met this secluded cultivator several times, he left a deep impression on Miao Ming Shen. The truth was, Miao Ming Shen did not want to invite Chu Ying. But because Chu Ying and Ren Xiu Ping had a conflict long ago, because he saved the lives of Feng Jiang and Hua Die, and most importantly, because he seemed to have an abundant amount of lifespan Gu, all these reasons made Miao Ming Shen inclined to invite Chu Ying for this trip.\n\nHe was the only one who knew the location of the blue dragon whale. Therefore, all of the people he invited owed him a favor.\n\nMiao Ming Shen wanted to cooperate more deeply with Fang Yuan. Forget the rest, just the amount of lifespan Gu that Fang Yuan had was extremely alluring to Miao Ming Shen.\n\nZeng Luo Zi’s action made Chu Ying’s expression change too.\n\nAs for Tu Tou Tuo and Tong Hua, it was unsure whether they were unaffected or pretending to put up a front.\n\nMiao Ming Shen looked at everyone as he laughed heartily: “Zeng Luo Zi, you have good methods.”\n\nTu Tou Tuo snorted while Tong Hua gave Zeng Luo Zi a cold stare.\n\nFang Yuan looked at Zeng Luo Zi with a surprised expression, but he was laughing coldly inside.\n\nZeng Luo Zi’s gaze swept past Chu Ying, before meeting with Tu Tou Tuo and Tong Hua’s gazes, he laughed heartily as he tossed out some information path mortal Gu.\n\nThe information path mortal Gu recorded the fine details of the alliance agreement, after inspecting them, the immortals nodded their heads in agreement, while also suggesting some changes.\n\nOf course, these changes were small and negligible, Miao Ming Shen took charge as the leader and after coming to an agreement, they signed it using Zeng Luo Zi’s methods.\n\nOnce the alliance agreement was made, everyone laughed as the atmosphere became less tense.\n\n“It is time, let’s go.” Miao Ming Shen moved at lightning speed as the immortals followed him.\n\nMiao Ming Shen flew in the sky for a while before diving into the sea.\n\n“We can’t hide in the sky, it is easy to find us. If Ren Xiu Ping learns of this expedition, he would not wait aimlessly. If we enter the sea, that means we are going to use the undercurrent…”\n\nFang Yuan speculated inwardly.\n\nAs expected, after a while, Miao Ming Shen led everyone to the bottom of the sea, they saw a huge python-like undercurrent crossing the trenches in the sea.\n\nMiao Ming Shen’s speed gradually slowed down until he arrived before the undercurrent.\n\nMiao Ming Shen looked at Zeng Luo Zi: “Before entering the undercurrent, for our safety and to ensure we will not be separated, Zeng Luo Zi, I would like you to use that immortal killer move to mark us and allow us to sense each other’s location.”\n\nThis was another way to control them.\n\nBut Miao Ming Shen did not say it before the alliance agreement, he had said it before entering the undercurrent, nobody could rebuke his sensible words.\n\n“Miao Ming Shen, are you sure?” Zeng Luo Zi pretended to hesitate.\n\nMiao Ming Shen smiled: “We have already made the agreement, we need to work together sincerely, how can we not trust each other when exploring Paradise Earth’s true inheritance?”\n\nHe said in a serious tone, Tu Tou Tuo, Tong Hua, and the rest nodded in agreement without objection.\n\nZeng Luo Zi looked around: “Then everyone, don’t be nervous or defensive, my move has no offensive capability.”\n\nFang Yuan mentally rolled his eyes as he said: “Go ahead and do it.”\n\n“Let me go first.” Feng Jiang stepped forward at once.\n\nZeng Luo Zi first used the immortal killer move on Feng Jiang before the rest took turns.\n\nAfter a while, all of the immortals were affected by the information path killer move, they could sense each other’s locations.\n\n“It is fine now, please follow me, the undercurrents are extremely fast, if you are slow by a step, you will be thrown far behind.” Miao Ming Shen said as he entered the undercurrent.\n\nFang Yuan and the rest followed after him rapidly.\n\nEastern Sea’s deep sea undercurrents did not have fixed paths, they were always changing and had various lengths, it was a display of the great power of nature.\n\nMoving along the undercurrent, the immortals were faster than some movement immortal killer moves, and most importantly, they saved a lot of energy, only having to put up defenses.\n\nIf there were water path Gu Immortals who had methods to move rapidly in the undercurrents, they could even defend themselves while fighting enemies here.\n\nFang Yuan was towards the rear of the group, he found that this group’s formation was quite specific. For example, Immortal Hua Die was right beside him, talking to him constantly.\n\nFang Yuan entertained her on the surface while secretly inspecting his information path dao marks.\n\nAfter a while, Fang Yuan relaxed.\n\nThese information path dao marks were not hard to get rid of, Fang Yuan had lots of methods. He even had immortal killer moves like self cleansing to resist these information path restrictions.\n\nBut now was not the time.\n\n“Everyone, we are about to go out, follow me!” Ahead, Miao Ming Shen suddenly spoke.\n\nAfter several breaths, he left the undercurrent, the rest followed, nobody was left behind.\n\nAfter leaving, Fang Yuan found that he was in an ordinary nameless sea area.\n\nIn the following journey, the immortals used several undercurrents to travel, if there were no undercurrents, they would travel under the sea as well, being extremely low profile. Even if they met desolate beasts or ancient desolate beasts, they avoided them. If they saw any resources, they would ignore them.\n\nAfter several days of traveling, the group became more cohesive.\n\nMiao Ming Shen was very skillful in human interaction, he solidified his position as the leader.\n\nHe was smiling when he suddenly froze, saying: “We are near!”\n\nThe immortals were energized.\n\nFang Yuan felt a little suspicious, he had used several investigative killer moves but could not sense anything. He could not see what method Miao Ming Shen had used or why he was so confident.\n\nThe blue dragon whale’s existence was known to everyone. But its exact location was a mystery, Miao Ming Shen must have a unique method to know its location.\n\nFang Yuan had rank eight cultivation level with immense battle strength, it was possible to kill Miao Ming Shen and search his soul. But there were risks involved, Gu Immortals had all sorts of mysterious methods, if he possessed some strange abilities, there might be mishaps occurring.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan continued to lurk, it would not be too late if he attacked after getting into the blue dragon whale.\n\nAs they got closer, the immortals started to sense the peculiarity.\n\nThe seawater became more turbulent ahead, if earlier was a drizzle, it was a storm now, the obstruction was far greater.\n\nDesolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts increased in numbers, they could not help themselves in this huge storm.\n\nFang Yuan and the rest had to fight while moving, slaughtering a bunch of desolate beasts before they carved out a bloody path to move on.\n\nAt this time, everyone’s strength was displayed.\n\nFeng Jiang and Immortal Hua Die had the lowest battle strength, they were soon the ones who needed protection. Miao Ming Shen was leading the group as the vanguard, facing the greatest pressure.\n\nBehind him were Tong Hua and Zeng Luo Zi.\n\nTu Tou Tuo was an earth path Gu Immortal, his battle strength was greatly restricted in this place.\n\nNext was Fang Yuan, he had already turned into a tiny seahorse that was palm sized, he moved like lightning speed. His strength was only mid-tier in the group, it was nothing impressive.\n\nThe journey ahead was getting tougher, from the groups of beasts, figures of immemorial desolate beasts started to appear, the immortals could no longer move forward so casually.\n\nThe ‘strongest’ Miao Ming Shen was merely rank seven.\n\nFollowing Miao Ming Shen, they flew out of the sea, arriving in the sky.\n\nRumble!\n\nIntense tornadoes surged in the sky, lightning flashed continuously as thunder rumbled, dark clouds extended to the horizons.\n\nWaves surged from the sea, they were thousands of feet tall.\n\nThe situation was just as dangerous as underwater!\n\nCountless flying birds and eagles fought intensely amidst the thunder and lightning.\n\nBlue charm lightning shadows flickered in the dark clouds, they were hunted down by immemorial desolate beast thunder phoenix.\n\nSeeing the tail of the thunder phoenix flash by, Miao Ming Shen and the rest breathed in deeply in shock.\n\n“Quick, follow me!” Miao Ming Shen transmitted, his body was covered in sweat, he flew forward rapidly.\n\nThe Gu Immortals all had their hidden methods, but this situation was too chaotic, the safest solution was to get away from this place as quickly as possible.\n\nThe thunder phoenix screeched as it discovered Fang Yuan and the rest, diving down.\n\nThe seawater erupted as an immemorial octopus large as a mountain moved its countless tentacles, treating Miao Ming Shen and the rest as prey for food.\n\n“Damn it, damn it!” Miao Ming Shen’s expression was distorted, he almost broke his teeth from gritting too hard.\n\nEven before meeting the blue dragon whale, they were already in a desperate situation, the aura of death was close.\n\n“Split up and run!” After hesitating for a while, Miao Ming Shen screamed.\n\nThe Gu Immortals quickly split up and ran.\n\nCrack!\n\nThe thunder phoenix was extremely fast, arriving before Fang Yuan in the blink of an eye.\n\n“Chu Ying!” Immortal Hua Die was dragged along by Gui Qi Ye, upon seeing this, she screamed in fear.\n\n“Save me!” Fang Yuan shouted with a look of despair on his face.\n\nNext, the thunder phoenix arrived in a flash, burning him to a crisp by lightning as he died on the spot.\n\n“Chu Ying…” Seeing this, the remaining seven immortals were shocked, they escaped in an even greater panic."
