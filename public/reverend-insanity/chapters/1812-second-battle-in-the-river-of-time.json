  "content": "Chapter 1812 Second Battle in the River of Time!\n\nInside Myriad Year Flying Warship, Hei Lou Lan and the rest felt their hearts throbbing.\n\nThe scene was too grand, the year beast army was charging towards them from all directions with a great momentum.\n\n“Such an amazing killer move!”\n\n“No wonder this move was never used inside the sovereign immortal aperture.”\n\n“Too many year beasts are lured in, if it was used inside the sovereign immortal aperture, it would definitely lead to a great catastrophe.”\n\nHeavenly Court’s side was also shaken.\n\n“Myriad Year Flying Warship…” Gu Liu Ru mumbled this name with a serious expression.\n\nLi Huang was also solemn as he spoke: “This is already a beast tide now, its power is actually so great!”\n\nEven a legendary character like him was highly impressed at such a majestic sight.\n\nFang Yuan showed a slight smile.\n\nHe had derived myriad year hunting from immemorial year beast fishing formation and developed it to its limit. With years flow like water Immortal Gu as the core and the amplification from the River of Time, it resulted in an extraordinary power.\n\nCountless beasts roared in the beast tide.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nHeavenly Court attacked the year beast tsunami with all kinds of killer moves.\n\nWaves after waves of year beasts were killed, Heavenly Court’s two time path Immortal Gu Houses were both of rank seven level and could match rank eight battle strength, they had no issue in dealing with most of the year beasts.\n\nBut the problem was, what was the use in simply killing these year beasts? As long as Myriad Year Flying Warship still existed, there would be an endless flow of year beasts.\n\nThis was an enslavement path battle tactic to consume Heavenly Court’s battle strength.\n\nThe explosive killer moves that Heavenly Court’s people used expended a lot of immortal essence.\n\n“If we fight with these year beasts, we will be falling into Fang Yuan’s scheme. We need to destroy Myriad Year Flying Warship and this will all end!” A rank seven Gu Immortal inside Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform suggested.\n\nThe moment he had finished speaking, a Gu Immortal beside him spoke: “But we already know how sturdy Myriad Year Flying Warship is. How can we adopt the tactic of attacking directly?”\n\nThe rank seven Gu Immortal was speechless: “This…”\n\nImmediately after, he heard shouting in his surroundings: “Careful! Fang Yuan is coming over again!!”\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship’s speed rose, but instead of retreating, it charged directly into Shark Flow Lever.\n\n“Such audacity!” Li Huang who was inside Shark Flow Lever shouted, Fang Yuan actually dared to come back, he clearly looked down on them.\n\nImmediately, Heavenly Court’s two Immortal Gu Houses and time path great expert Gu Liu Ru surrounded and attacked Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship took the waves of attacks firmly as countless silver swords shone around it and then shot out like a rainstorm.\n\nBoth sides went at each other, the intensity of the battle reached an extreme level immediately.\n\n“Not good! Fang Yuan is trying to delay us so that this year beast army can surround us!” Gu Liu Ru saw Fang Yuan’s plan.\n\nLi Huang smiled coldly: “As long as we wholeheartedly concentrate on breaking through the siege, so what if there are even more of these year beasts?”\n\nGu Liu Ru sighed: “Don’t forget we still have the river suppression lotus sealing formation behind us.”\n\nLi Huang was stumped, he had forgotten about that in this moment of urgency; after being reminded, his mind jolted as he cursed: “This scoundrel Fang Yuan is truly insidious and vicious!”\n\nHeavenly Court had constructed the river suppression lotus sealing formation painstakingly, it could slowly drift along the surface of the River of Time. There were a large number of Gu Immortals garrisoned inside, controlling their respective formation cores.\n\nIf this large formation was destroyed, Heavenly Court’s losses would not only be a lot of Immortal Gu but also these rank seven Gu Immortals.\n\nMoreover, they probably would not be able to construct another river suppression lotus sealing formation within a short period of time!\n\nHeavenly Court’s situation was quite awkward.\n\nThey wanted to use the river suppression lotus sealing formation to ambush Fang Yuan, but it was seen through by Fang Yuan, now, this formation instead became Heavenly Court’s weakness and was used by Fang Yuan.\n\nThe river suppression lotus sealing formation could float but its speed was very slow, there was no chance of it escaping the current battle.\n\n“Let’s first slowly recall the Gu Immortals inside the formation.” Gu Liu Ru said after a while of thinking.\n\nLi Huang, however, said at almost the same time: “Kill Fang Yuan, everything will be settled once we kill this source of evil.”\n\nThe two Gu Immortals glanced at each other, at this crucial moment, they had different thoughts.\n\nRoar!\n\nBecause of Fang Yuan, the frontmost year beasts reached the battlefield.\n\nAt the lead were three immemorial year beasts.\n\nThese immemorial year beasts had a tough physique, they endured Heavenly Court’s bombardment and charged right into the battlefield of Immortal Gu Houses.\n\n“Seeking death!” Li Huang shouted in fury, he controlled the huge sharks in front of Shark Flow Lever to bite at them.\n\nAt the same time, he also activated Shark Flow Lever’s killer move, within a dozen breaths of time, two immemorial year beasts were beaten to death one after the other.\n\n“Foolish clowns!” Li Huang’s killing intent was leaking when he heard Gu Liu Ru’s shout —”Help me quickly!”\n\nLi Huang had gone to deal with the immemorial year beasts, while Gu Liu Ru and Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform attacked Myriad Year Flying Warship and brought the battle to a temporary deadlock.\n\nBut soon after, Fang Yuan activated daybreak sword and bombarded the river suppression lotus sealing formation.\n\nThis formation was strong inside and weak outside, it was originally meant to deal with the stone lotus island, but after this vicious attack by Fang Yuan, it immediately became unstable with many areas crumbling apart.\n\nThe Gu Immortals inside the formation cores lost their lives immediately.\n\nWith Myriad Year Flying Warship’s extremely tough defense, Gu Liu Ru and Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform were unable to do any harm to it. They were forced to block Fang Yuan’s attacks to defend the retreating Gu Immortals inside the large formation.\n\nAs such, Fang Yuan gained the initiative, he could casually attack anywhere he wanted, Gu Liu Ru and Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform were in a miserable state, unable to cope with the attacks from all directions.\n\nLi Huang saw that the situation was bad, he quickly detoured and attacked Myriad Year Flying Warship from the back.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had no fear!\n\nIf it were him alone, he might not be able to pay attention to all sides, but he had many experienced Gu Immortal subordinates inside the vessel to help him. And to get the battle merit of killing another rank eight, their eyes were bloodshot with excitement.\n\nFang Yuan stood on the bow of the boat from the beginning, regardless of how dangerous and chaotic it was outside, suddenly, he saw a gap in Gu Liu Ru’s defense and activated a killer move.\n\nSpring scissors!\n\nSpring scissors flew out, it was not targeted towards Gu Liu Ru, instead it dodged his obstruction, and ‘snip’, beheaded a female immortal.\n\nGu Liu Ru’s heart jumped with fright: “Isn’t this Xia Cha’s trump card method? Fang Yuan has already grasped it and even modified it to suit his rank seven cultivation!”\n\nFang Yuan laughed heartily as he activated summer fan, which was also at rank seven level.\n\nLi Huang was unable to pay attention to both sides and could only look on as wind howled and blew even more holes in the river suppression lotus sealing formation, instantly destroying several Immortal Gu.\n\n“Hahaha, I want to kill them, can you stop me?” Fang Yuan laughed loudly and mockingly.\n\nLi Huang’s eyes burned with anger as he shouted: “Scoundrel, I will grind your bones to ashes!”\n\nBoom!\n\nAn immemorial year beast rammed into Myriad Year Flying Warship, slightly tilting the rank eight Immortal Gu House.\n\nHeavenly Court’s side was stumped.\n\nAlmost at an instant, the two rank eight great experts reacted.\n\n“It turns out Fang Yuan can only lure in the year beast tide and not control them!”\n\n“It even seems like these year beasts’ target is Myriad Year Flying Warship!!”\n\nAfter discovering this secret, Li Huang and Gu Liu Ru had the urge to cough blood.\n\nThey had fought wholeheartedly for so long but it turned out they were actually blocking the enemy for Fang Yuan!\n\nNo wonder Fang Yuan did not watch from the sidelines, instead charging over to pester them.\n\nFang Yuan was helpless about this.\n\nHe had already done his best in the current situation.\n\nUsing Years Flow Like Water to attract year beasts and incite a year beast tide, this was the power of time path. If he could control this year beast army, that would be enslavement path’s power.\n\nYear beasts continued to come in from all around, making the battlefield extremely cramped.\n\nPreviously, Heavenly Court was still bombarding this year beast tide and had slightly slowed them down. But because of Fang Yuan attacking river suppression lotus sealing formation constantly and killing many rank seven Gu Immortals, Heavenly Court’s side had no time to attend to the beast tide.\n\n“Die, Fang Yuan!”\n\n“Get lost!!”\n\nLi Huang shouted, but Fang Yuan controlled Myriad Year Flying Warship to cling onto Shark Flow Lever or Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform.\n\nThe year beasts’ target was Myriad Year Flying Warship, but because of this, Shark Flow Lever and Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform also met with calamity.\n\n“Don’t you want to get rid of me? I am right in front of you now, come on, attack me.” Fang Yuan laughed.\n\nLi Huang’s eyes were bloodshot with anger, even Gu Liu Ru’s breathing hastened as he looked rigidly at Fang Yuan with a deep cold gaze filled with killing intent.\n\nThe three Immortal Gu Houses soon did not even have space to move!\n\nIf someone looked from afar, they could only see year beasts rushing to the battlefield in the center. These year beasts, ancient year beasts, and immemorial year beasts were packed so tightly that they looked like a sphere of ants.\n\nAnd the sphere was getting tighter and denser along with getting increasingly larger.\n\nThe three Immortal Gu Houses in the middle of the sphere seemed to have turned into meat grinders, even an immemorial year beast would be ground to death within a dozen seconds.\n\nLi Huang and Gu Liu Ru attacked furiously.\n\nThe river suppression lotus sealing formation was already destroyed completely. Heavenly Court’s efforts this time had all gone to waste.\n\nLi Huang and Gu Liu Ru had already tried their best to save any Gu Immortal they could, but most of them still died miserably at Fang Yuan’s hands.\n\n“Let’s leave now, otherwise there will be no survivors.” Gu Liu Ru called out.\n\nWithout the large formation hindering Fang Yuan, Fang Yuan rampaged in the battlefield with Myriad Year Flying Warship, no one was able to stop him.\n\nHeavenly Court’s battle tactics had failed completely.\n\n“Fang Yuan, just wait, you won’t be able to be arrogant for long, you will die by my hands sooner or later!” Li Huang said with clenched teeth.\n\nThis was the first time he fought with Fang Yuan, and he already felt extreme hatred, anger, and disgust because of Fang Yuan’s actions!\n\nThis demon was truly insidious and crafty!\n\n“Hmph! Li Huang, I think you are the one who is arrogant!” Myriad Year Flying Warship suddenly erupted, the killer move torrential charge activated under it! At its surroundings were daybreak swords! The silver swords pierced into the torrent and exploded with an unimaginable speed!\n\n“These two moves can be combined?!” Li Huang cried out in shock, caught off guard.\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship directly collided into the damaged Shark Flow Lever!\n\nBam!\n\nAmidst the loud sound, Shark Flow Lever was directly destroyed, the remaining huge sharks dying on the spot.\n\nAt the crucial moment, Li Huang activated his proudest killer move, verdant sun flame cloak.\n\nMyriad Year Flying Warship destroyed Shark Flow Lever and collided straight into Li Huang with its remaining momentum.\n\nLi Huang’s verdant sun flame cloak shook intensely, it was like a prairie fire but after the collision, it immediately weakened to become a small flame.\n\n“Li Huang, it is time for your death!” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone sharply as he used both summer fan and spring scissors to attack Li Huang.\n\n“Rank eight?!” Li Huang stared with his eyes wide open as he felt a fatal threat from summer fan and spring scissors.\n\nHe did not even have time to breathe as he focused everything on defense.\n\nBut when he took on the killer moves, spring scissors and summer fan revealed their previous state — they were only at rank seven!\n\n“Fang Yuan, you deceived me!” Li Huang roared, his attention was completely on Fang Yuan.\n\nImmediately after, Myriad Year Flying Warship followed.\n\nLi Huang’s eyes almost popped out as his sight became filled with the large silver figure of Myriad Year Flying Warship.\n\nBoom!\n\nLi Huang’s flame cloak was completely extinguished, his chest caved in, from which blood, mixed with pieces of organs, spurted out like a fountain.\n\nWhoosh.\n\nCountless silver swords attacked at the next second, they were as densely packed as bees, they pierced deep into Li Huang’s body and exited out from all directions.\n\nLi Huang’s body was moved around in all directions by daybreak swords, shaking intensely in the process.\n\nThe sharp light in his pupils dissipated rapidly.\n\nBefore death, his final thought was still disbelief: “I am actually going to die here?!”\n\n“Retreat——!” Gu Liu Ru shouted with teary eyes.\n\nVeins bulged on his forehead and his whole face looked malevolent.\n\nLi Huang might be stronger than Gu Liu Ru but in this River of Time, without the protection of an Immortal Gu House, he was definitely more disadvantaged.\n\nIt was not that Gu Liu Ru did not think of going to save him, but Fang Yuan had prepared for so long, how could he give him the chance to rescue?\n\nThe tightly packed year beasts were also a huge hindrance.\n\nGu Liu Ru controlled Three Autumn Yellow Crane Platform and left the battlefield rapidly.\n\nFang Yuan gave chase with surging killing intent: “Heavenly Court Gu Immortals, this will be your final resting place.”\n\nGu Liu Ru gave a muffled groan as he concentrated on escaping.\n\nHe imprinted this disgrace deep in his heart: “Righteous is falling while demonic is rising… sigh! The most sensible option now is to preserve our strength and fight again in the future. Fang Yuan… you can continue to be arrogant for the time being.”"
