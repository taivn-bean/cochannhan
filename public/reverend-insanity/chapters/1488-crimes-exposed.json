And the battle was even conducted in the battlefield killer move purple star broken life.\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng could not find anything, he felt suspicious.\n\n“Fairy Bai He is an expert among rank seven Gu Immortals, it is unlikely that anyone can kill her stealthily. Unless it is a rank eight Gu Immortal…”\n\n“But rank eights usually govern a domain and restrict each other, any movement from them would cause a huge commotion, how could they come to kill Fairy Bai He without reason? Hehe.”\n\nThinking of this, Qing Yue Zhi Cheng’s worries lifted.\n\nBut soon, his expression turned stiff: “Don’t tell me Fairy Bai He got sick of me and decided to change locations and moved all her resources with her?”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng thought about it, the possibility was slim.\n\nWhite crane sea area produced a lot of resources, how could Qin Bai He give up on it? Even if she found a better area, there was no reason to leave this place alone.\n\n“Unless, she encountered an unbeatable enemy? Against such a strong foe, she had no choice but to give up and retreat?”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng had another thought.\n\nBut soon, he shook his head: “If she met with a strong enemy, why would Fairy Bai He not seek help? With her network, with just one word, she would receive a lot of help from various Gu Immortals.”\n\n“So what happened exactly? Why did Fairy Bai He vanish so mysteriously?”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng frowned deeply.\n\nHe did not think that Qin Bai He was dead, firstly, he did not want to think in that direction, secondly, that possibility was too bizarre.\n\nQin Bai He was a famous person in Eastern Sea’s Gu Immortal world, her strength was not weak, she was rank seven.\n\nWho could easily kill such a person?\n\nLike what Qing Yue Zhi Cheng had said, unless it was a rank eight Gu Immortal.\n\nBut this possibility was even slimmer.\n\nThe five regions have been in peace for too long, Qing Yue Zhi Cheng subconsciously felt that such a cruel murder would not occur, and it would definitely not happen to his beloved fairy.\n\nBut after his investigation, Qing Yue Zhi Cheng had a conclusion.\n\n“Regardless of what happened, Fairy Bai He must be in trouble, I need to find her and help her!”\n\nAt once, the thought of the hero saving the beauty appeared in Qing Yue Zhi Cheng’s mind.\n\n“If there are no clues here, I will find the nearby Gu Immortals and ask them.” You Chan’s name soon appeared in Qing Yue Zhi Cheng’s mind.\n\nYou Chan’s dragonfish sea area was famous too.\n\nAnd in terms of distance, You Chan was closest to Qin Bai He.\n\nThey were basically neighbors.\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng moved with lightning speed, he immediately left white crane sea area and spent some effort to reach dragonfish sea area.\n\nDragonfish sea area was in a worse state than white crane sea area, this place used to have countless dragonfish swimming about in millions per group, it was one of the most amazing sights in Eastern Sea, but now, it was empty.\n\nA breeze was blowing as the seawater became turbulent, waves were created endlessly.\n\n“What is happening?”\n\n“Even dragonfish sea area was robbed?!”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng was tongue-tied, he expressed shock in his eyes.\n\nQin Bai He and You Chan’s sea areas were in such states, who was the one who caused this?\n\nAfter all, both You Chan and Qin Bai He were powerful rank seven experts, they were not weak at all!\n\nThis time, Qing Yue Zhi Cheng not only felt suspicion, he felt fear.\n\nHe came extremely alert, he went deep into the sea to investigate, but the sad thing was he found out nothing.\n\n“How can this be? What happened exactly? Not just Fairy Bai He, even Fairy You Chan also encountered this. Wait, the dragonfish business, treasure yellow heaven!”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng’s body shook as he connected to treasure yellow heaven.\n\nYou Chan’s dragonfish business was famous in all five regions, she definitely had her will in treasure yellow heaven to manage the dragonfish business.\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng’s consciousness entered treasure yellow heaven as he quickly contacted You Chan’s will.\n\nOnce they conversed, Qing Yue Zhi Cheng found out that You Chan’s will had no idea what happened!\n\n“You Chan and her will communicate quite frequently, the interval is at most three days each time. This means that in the last three days, she and Fairy Bai He have encountered a mysterious attack!”\n\nQing Yue Zhi Cheng’s felt sweat dripping off his forehead.\n\nThe more he investigated, the more he uncovered the truth, it was mysterious and terrifying.\n\nBe it You Chan or Qin Bai He, they would not take away the resources randomly and run away. All this showed that they had met with an unstoppable threat!\n\nAn intense worry filled Qing Yue Zhi Cheng’s heart.\n\n“No, I need to get home and get help from the Gu Immortals in my clan!” Qing Yue Zhi Cheng looked at the empty dragonfish sea area as he felt a chill down his spine, he quickly returned and did not dare to stay any longer.\n\nQin Bai He’s and You Chan’s murder was exposed. Even though there was no evidence pointing to the two fairies’ deaths, with Qing Yue clan’s great strength, they quickly unveiled a portion of the truth.\n\nMeanwhile, the culprit behind this murder case was scot-free, flying casually in Western Desert.\n\nAfter leaving Eastern Sea, Fang Yuan did not go to Northern Plains, instead, he went past Southern Border and arrived in Western Desert.\n\nAbove the clouds, Fang Yuan’s consciousness entered the sovereign immortal aperture as he inspected his gains from Eastern Sea.\n\nAfter killing You Chan and Qin Bai He, Fang Yuan’s gains were huge.\n\nHe gained a large number of dragonfish, the scale far surpassed dragon scale sea area, they were living all over Mini Eastern Sea now.\n\nHe also got a high quantity of great history iron and egg crystal rocks.\n\nThere were also two rank six Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan had already started arranging their food.\n\nQin Bai He’s wood path immortal aperture was left in Eastern Sea, he could not annex it or bring it with him. You Chan’s water path immortal aperture was already annexed, he gained a huge sea area and a large number of water path dao marks!\n\nBut these gains were far inferior to City Well.\n\nIndeed, the secluded domain of heaven and earth, City Well, was now in Fang Yuan’s sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan went to Eastern Sea, he first went to turbulent flow sea area and moved the City Well that was left there into sovereign immortal aperture. After that, he went to dragonfish sea area and killed You Chan and Qin Bai He.\n\nSecluded Domain of Heaven and Earth — City Well!\n\nFang Yuan had wanted to get City Well long ago, but back then, pulling mountain Immortal Gu was ineffective against it, he could not relocate it into his immortal aperture.\n\nBut now, using the light of wisdom, he created an immortal killer move using pulling mountain Immortal Gu as the core, to target and move City Well, after a long time of hard work, he succeeded!"
