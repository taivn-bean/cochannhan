According to the earlier agreement, next he had to travel towards the center of the blessed land, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s former place of residence was there — Northern Plains Sacred Palace!\n\n“I am finally in here.” Fang Yuan regulated his breathing, the Imperial Court contest was only a prelude, what was truly important was the following events.\n\nHe tried activating eagle rise Gu, his crystal purple primeval essence moved according to his will, entering the eagle rise Gu.\n\nSwoosh!\n\nWith a light sound, followed by intense pain, two broad and huge pitch-black eagle wings grew on his back.\n\nWithin Imperial Court blessed land, the use of mortal Gu was not restricted. As for Immortal Gu, they could not be restrained in any blessed land.\n\nThe strong eagle wings flapped lightly and brought Fang Yuan into the air.\n\nFlying in the air, feeling the light wind brushing past his face, he could smell the unique scent of nature that permeated the entire blessed land.\n\nCompared to the outside world, this place was extremely peaceful, it was like heaven.\n\nFang Yuan was in no hurry, he flew slowly as he enjoyed the scenery around him.\n\nImperial Court blessed land’s landscape was quite similar to northern plains. At one glance, it was a huge plain, there were mounds and slopes with beautiful and elegant lines, it was like a stream of jade green flowing smoothly without obstacles.\n\nBut different from northern plains, every eight li, there would be a tower on the ground.\n\nThese towers made Fang Yuan think of totem pillars. Each one was about twenty-five meters tall, they were tall and straight, with a gold and silver surface, with lots of precious gems adorning it, beautiful and exquisite.\n\nIn the tower, there were countless barriers, like a beehive. Inside, were many Gu worms.\n\nWhen the worm groups in the blessed land give birth to Gu, these Gu worms would detach themselves from the group and live in these towers.\n\nThe towers were built by Giant Sun, no matter what type of Gu worm it was, they would be able to find their food inside the towers.\n\nEvery tower had tens of thousands of Gu worms. These Gu consists of many species, there were large numbers of common Gu and few rare Gu.\n\nUndeniably, each of these towers were a huge fortune, even Fang Yuan can feel his attraction to them. He could even see a group of about a thousand starlight firefly Gu in one of the towers.\n\n“Unfortunately, I cannot take these Gu as I wish. When the Imperial Court contest first started, some daring Gu Masters tried to steal or even attack the towers, to take the wild Gu inside. In the end, they were like candles, their entire body melted until their white bone skeleton was left, smashed into a pile.” Fang Yuan’s gaze concentrated.\n\nThis was the heavenly power of the blessed land, the power of heaven and earth.\n\nNo mortals could resist it.\n\nEven Gu Immortals would be left in a pathetic state when competing against it.\n\nAfter enough lessons taught, by now, no Gu Master had the intention to attack the towers.\n\n“If we chase the origin, the Gu Immortal who created Imperial Court blessed land was a space path Gu Immortal whose name can no longer be found. Because of this, this blessed land is huge, far larger than other blessed lands. Before Giant Sun Immortal Venerable became an immortal, he inherited this place luckily and became the blessed land’s new owner. After Giant Sun became an Immortal Venerable, and obtained unparalleled power, he displayed great methods and set up the tradition of the Imperial Court contest, allowing this ancient blessed land to continue existing until now.\n\nFang Yuan flew as he recalled.\n\nThe methods of an Immortal Venerable were beyond his understanding. Who knows how Giant Sun Immortal Venerable managed to do it, but the result was, under his manipulation, Imperial Court blessed land no longer suffered from heavenly tribulations or earthly calamities.\n\nHiss hiss hiss…\n\nAfter flying for an hour, past numerous towers, Fang Yuan was provoked by a giant python on a small valley.\n\nThis bright red giant python was at least a hundred meters long, its body was as thick as a tower.\n\nThere was a sharp horn on its head, a pair of blood eyes stared at Fang Yuan fixatedly, hissing with its tongue continuously.\n\nIts tongue was a creepy purple color, and there were eerie blue flames on it.\n\n“Eh? It’s a rarely seen eerie fire dragon python.” Fang Yuan was slightly shocked.\n\nAt this moment, the giant python opened its mouth, and shot out a carriage-sized blue purple flame.\n\nThe flame approached quickly, as the temperature in the air rose sharply, from a few hundred steps away, Fang Yuan’s hair and eyebrows were showing signs of drying up. It showed the terrifying temperature of the blue purple flame!\n\nFang Yuan’s eyebrows rose as he flapped his eagle wings, going to a higher altitude and avoiding the flame easily.\n\nKiller move — Four Arm Wind King!\n\nHe activated more than ten Gu worms at once, his crystal purple was expending rapidly, meanwhile two bronze arms grew out of his body.\n\nThereafter, he flew down like a comet, straight towards the python.\n\nBam!\n\nHe crashed fiercely into the eerie fire dragon python, engaging in fierce combat with it.\n\nAt once, smoke rose as shockwaves were sent out, flames shot out as the valley shook.\n\nEerie fire dragon python was a mutated beast king, mutated beasts has rank four battle strength, while their king had strength equivalent to a rank five Gu Master. But Fang Yuan was rank five peak stage long ago, and after using his killer move, his battle strength was even higher.\n\nIf the eerie fire dragon python laid low and hid itself, Fang Yuan might not have noticed it while being on the move. But since it provoked him on purpose, Fang Yuan felt the urge to hunt and improve his killer move by using it as a training dummy.\n\nAfter half an hour, the battle was over.\n\nFang Yuan’s body was charred black, he stood in the completely destroyed and ruined valley.\n\nThe eerie fire dragon python’s huge body was half covered in broken mountain rocks.\n\nFang Yuan coughed a few times, throwing up some blood.\n\nThe improved killer move had much less severe aftermath than before. A part of the reason was that the eerie fire dragon python did not have wisdom like humans, it could not find out Fang Yuan’s weakness amidst battle.\n\nIf the wind was restricted, Fang Yuan would be in a much worse state.\n\nThis battle was not easy.\n\nImperial Court blessed land was a great environment, there were many Gu worms, thus there was a larger number of fire path wild Gu worms on the eerie fire dragon python. Among them, there were several valuable ones.\n\nFang Yuan’s killer move was strong, but it did not have much defense against fire path.\n\nIf he did not need to dodge the flames, the thirty minute battle would be faster by at least a third.\n\nFang Yuan started collecting his loot.\n\nThis mutated beast king’s body was full of value. For example, the python blood was a top ingredient in feeding blood path Gu worms. The python skin, tendons etc, would cause a huge commotion if sold in the mortal market.\n\nEspecially the eerie fire snake gall, it was extremely valuable, it could even be sold in treasure yellow heaven.\n\nFang Yuan organised his gains, in order to save time, he only kept the valuable items in his Gu.\n\n“Eerie fire dragon python, they live in caves as a family. If there are any young dragon pythons, I can capture them and place them inside Hu Immortal blessed land to breed. It would be a good investment for the future.” Fang Yuan thought about this and searched around.\n\nVery soon, he made a discovery.\n\n“Eh? There’s a Gu Master inheritance here.” Fang Yuan did not find a baby dragon python, but found a bright red rock, like that of a fire lotus.\n\nWith his expertise, he quickly understood that this was a Gu Master’s work.\n\nWhen he got close to the huge rock, this fire lotus-like rock opened up in layers, like a blossoming lotus.\n\nThe fire lotus rock opened completely, showing the Gu worms inside as well as a stele.\n\nThe stele was one with the huge rock, there were northern plains words on it.\n\nFang Yuan read it thoroughly and understood its existence.\n\nThe fire path Gu Master who left behind his inheritance was called Huo Zheng Jun, he was a righteous rank four fire path Gu Master. He entered this valley by accident, and was attacked by the eerie fire dragon python. Before dying from his injuries, he left behind his Gu worms helplessly and made the inheritance.\n\nIn the future, if a fated individual comes here, them this set of Gu worms would be his.\n\nHuo Zheng Jun left behind seven Gu worms. But after these years, four died, and only three remained.\n\nAmong the three Gu worms, only one attracted Fang Yuan, it was the rank four fire pupil Gu.\n\nWhen a Gu Master uses fire pupil Gu, fire would burn at anywhere they looked at, burning their opponents. Such a convenient attacking method often caught people off guard.\n\nBut it had its weaknesses.\n\nIf it was used for a long time, the Gu Master’s eyes would be damaged. They would need to use good healing Gu as well as complementing Gu worms to weaken this side effect.\n\nThis fire pupil Gu was Huo Zheng Jun’s core Gu worm.\n\nAside from the Gu worms he left behind, there were Gu recipes that he recorded on the stele.\n\nFang Yuan looked at it three times, storing the information inside east window Gu.\n\nAlthough he did not cultivate fire path, these recipes were useful for him when researching about Gu refinement or even in his cultivation, as a form of inspiration. Especially the refinement recipe of the fire pupil Gu, it had high value.\n\nAccording to this Gu Master, rank four fire pupil Gu was advanced using rank three fire eye Gu, together with sight blow Gu and some associated Gu refinement materials.\n\nFang Yuan knew about rank three fire eye Gu, it was a one time expenditure Gu used for investigative purposes. It could transform the eyes into fire eyes, having the ability to see through fog, but it did not work every time, once it failed, one would turn blind.\n\nFang Yuan knew about sight blow Gu too, Hao Ji Liu from the Hei tribe army had one. He had once used it together with rank four location swap Gu.\n\nFang Yuan kept the fire pupil Gu, he did not intend to go onto the fire path.\n\nFire pupil Gu did not suit his current style. While the attacking method was convenient, it was very restrictive, it was too reliant on visual contact.\n\nThere were too many strange Gu in this world, there were countless methods to prevent eye contact.\n\nThere was no strongest Gu worm, only strongest Gu Master.\n\nGu worms were the hosts of the great Dao, they were fundamentally tools. When Gu master use them together, they could form great effects. Some combinations were even far superior and harder to counter, they were known as killer moves.\n\n“This means, this should be the first Gu Master inheritance I’ve obtained in Imperial Court blessed land.” Fang Yuan thought about it, feeling interested.\n\nIn Imperial Court blessed land, there were countless Gu Master inheritances.\n\nIt was because of the superb environment, in contrast, many inheritances in the main world were often destroyed by calamities and beasts before the fated person arrives.\n\nFurthermore, all the Gu Masters that entered Imperial Court blessed land were experts that had undergone tough battles, they had to have at least some superior qualities, if they were not heroes or grand conquerors already.\n\nThus, there were abundant inheritances inside Imperial Court blessed land. Anyone who was fated would have gains.\n\nFang Yuan kept the three Gu worms inside his aperture, before smashing the stele to bits.\n\nNext, he searched around, finding a cave indeed. He entered the cave and walked to the lowest part of it, at about a hundred meters underground, he found six eerie fire dragon python eggs.\n\nHe was troubled now.\n\nIf it was a baby eerie fire dragon python, he could bring them away to Hu Immortal blessed land and allow them to hunt freely.\n\nBut it was not easy to hatch an eerie fire dragon python’s egg. He needed to use eerie fire and python blood to bathe them daily. After the little dragon python hatches, they need to taught by the eerie fire dragon python personally, on how to use their strength to hunt.\n\nFang Yuan did not have the time or effort to waste just to hatch these eggs.\n\nThere was no choice, he quickly kept these eggs before getting out of the hot cave, flying towards the sky and continuing on his journey without any lingering feelings.\n\nChibiGeneral ChibiGeneral I would make scrambled eggs out of them 🙂"
