At the center of the lotus, there was the bud of a lotus flower.\n\nThe lotus flower had pure white jade-like petals, they were flawless and perfect, seemingly out of this world.\n\nOnce rank nine Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus was refined, it activated on its own, absorbing the surrounding primeval energy to convert them into clear dew beads.\n\nThese pure dew beads gathered as they flowed along the glazed leaves, gathering into the bud at the center droplet by droplet.\n\nThe white jade flower bud absorbed the dew droplets and started to turn pink at the top.\n\nFang Yuan personally refined this Immortal Gu, he was clear about this, the white jade flower bud would gather more dew droplets and turn from white to pink, and from pink to bright red.\n\nWhen the flower petals turned red completely, it would bloom and reveal the jade green lotus pod inside.\n\nWithin the lotus pod, there would be eighty-one lotus seeds, each of them was a yellow apricot immortal essence bead!\n\nAfter the yellow apricot immortal essence beads were extracted, the lotus flower would contract and turn white again. Next, it would absorb the clear dew droplets and restart the process again.\n\n“Rank nine Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus, Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable’s vital Gu, ranked sixth on the Immortal Gu list..” Information flashed past Fang Yuan’s mind, all of them proved the immense value of this Immortal Gu.\n\nBut the truth was, Fang Yuan knew that this sixth placing of the Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus was too much of an underestimate.\n\nThe reason?\n\nBefore fate Gu was destroyed, venerables were invincible, they ruled their own era as the sole supreme entity.\n\nEven though Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable had rank nine Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus and became the richest venerable in history in terms of immortal essence, this advantage was useless in his life.\n\nIn his era, he was the only venerable, he had no use for most of his rank nine immortal essence. Without any opponent, even an expert could only live his life mundanely!\n\nBut now was different, fate Gu was destroyed and the reign of three venerables appeared, others might even revive later.\n\n“Oh Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus, in my hands, you will shine brightly like never before!”\n\nFang Yuan was joyous.\n\nThis result made all the earlier risks worth it.\n\nEven though he paid a terrifying price.\n\nAdding in his earlier failures, Fang Yuan used up thirty percent of his rank nine wood path immortal materials!\n\n“The crisis is not over yet.” Fang Yuan analyzed calmly to himself.\n\nSurrounding him, a black soul river surged endlessly.\n\n“Break.” Fang Yuan shouted and activated his killer move, he barged out like a shooting star.\n\nWithout the Gu refinement burdening his thoughts, he had a lot of usable strength now.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable attacked again while Fang Yuan retreated.\n\n“Fang Yuan, let’s cooperate to attack him.” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable reminded.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable also stared at Fang Yuan intently, he used luck path methods unceasingly to try and see how much immortal essence Fang Yuan still had.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly, his expression was livid as he said angrily: “Are you two bullying me because of my age? We were all meant to attack together, but I ended up facing the brunt of his attacks, not only did you two not help me, you even let Spectral Soul Demon Venerable go off while you watched this by the sidelines? Is this your so-called cooperation?”\n\nSaying so, he activated a compound killer move as yellowish brown light shot out to block Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s attack.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable was silent before smiling and saying: “Fang Yuan, you are mistaken. Even though we cooperated, our dao marks conflict, making a move would have had negative effects instead.”\n\nSaying this, she waved her hand as a large amount of stardust landed on Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, breaking several hundred of his arms.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable also took action, golden light descended like sand and grinded away at Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s luck.\n\nFang Yuan relaxed his mind at this moment, he sighed to himself as he thought: This obscured heavenly secret killer move is really useful.\n\nThe situation earlier was simply too perilous.\n\nAs long as the two venerables sensed something wrong with Fang Yuan, they would attack him without restraint. But at that worst timing, he had too little immortal essence and could not fight them.\n\nIf they attacked him, Fang Yuan would have no choice but to try and run.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan did not have the white heavenly spirit anymore, this was still a worthwhile trade off.\n\nEven with all of Fang Yuan’s methods, it was only because he expended the white heavenly spirit that he could deceive both venerables at such a close range.\n\nBut Fang Yuan did not know how long he could continue to deceive them.\n\nAs Spectral Soul Demon Venerable roared, he activated burning soul bursting luck to block Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s golden sand.\n\nBut Spectral Soul Demon Venerable still charged at Fang Yuan!\n\nBecause Fang Yuan destroyed the white heavenly spirit, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable bore huge hatred towards him.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly, he did not fight back with force, he flew towards Star Constellation Immortal Venerable instead.\n\nThe three venerables fought against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, they had their own positions that were far away from each other. But now, Fang Yuan and Spectral Soul Demon Venerable moved quickly, they got close to her rapidly.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable snorted coldly as starlight flew out of her mouth and rained down like a storm.\n\nThe starlight rain surrounded Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s body like a river while shooting stars of various sizes shot out of the ripples.\n\nInstantly, countless flying stars appeared in the battlefield, it was a dazzling sight!\n\n“Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had such a move to summon so many stardust specks in a short period of time…” Fang Yuan shook internally.\n\nThese stardust specks were harmless to him.\n\nHe only had to wipe them to refine all of these star marks, he had the perfect counter to this combat system.\n\nBut Spectral Soul Demon Venerable could not do that.\n\nBecause he was not sane, after getting hit by the stardust specks, his body became covered in injuries, he roared angrily but his injuries accumulated.\n\n“Good chance!” Fang Yuan turned around and fought again, he unleashed another killer move.\n\nThis was a refinement path method.\n\nThe killer move shined with intense radiance, enveloping Spectral Soul Demon Venerable and eroding his soul beast body wherever the light went.\n\nBut Star Constellation Immortal Venerable frowned deeply as she shouted: “Fang Yuan, what are you trying to do?!”\n\nThe reason was that although Fang Yuan hurt Spectral Soul Demon Venerable with this move, the refinement path killer move was also used on the star path dao marks.\n\nFang Yuan got rid of over half the star marks that Star Constellation Immortal Venerable accumulated over this time.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable benefited from this and went back to a relaxed state.\n\n“A small blunder, it is just a mistake.” Fang Yuan laughed heartily.\n\nAfter a few rounds went by, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable also frowned, he spoke with a tone of anger: “Fang Yuan, what are your true intentions?!”\n\nFang Yuan said innocently: “I am trying to attack Spectral Soul Demon Venerable along with you. But we have conflicting dao marks, and a lack of cooperation normally, this will get better if we continue to fight.”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable snorted coldly together.\n\nFang Yuan was doing this on purpose, he was acting like a nuisance, disrupting Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s attacks.\n\nAfter a few more rounds.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable shouted angrily: “Fang Yuan, enough is enough! The immemorial soul beasts you released are all countered by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable. After devouring them, he recovered by thirty percent.”\n\nFang Yuan rubbed his nose: “I did not know that he had such methods.”\n\nSaying so, he brought out a few more immemorial soul beasts.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s eyes shined with starlight specks, she stared at Fang Yuan and said in an icy cold tone: “You are still letting more out?!”\n\nFang Yuan smiled plainly: “Star Constellation, don’t worry, I used a method on these immemorial soul beasts, this is part of my plan. Just watch.”\n\nNot long after, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable saw that Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s injuries were recovering even more rapidly, his mental energy also recovered as well.\n\nBefore the two venerables questioned him, Fang Yuan rubbed his nose: “Oh, it seems that my plan failed.”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable stayed silent while Star Constellation Immortal Venerable wanted to speak, but Fang Yuan suddenly snorted coldly: “Give me a minute I need to prepare a powerful method!”\n\nSaying so, he flew up to the sky and looked down at the battlefield.\n\nThe two venerables looked at each other before taking action to obstruct Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan’s preparation, a huge field of fire clouds appeared above him. From them, flaming meteors descended, they were all around the size of mountains, there was a long trail behind them as they crashed into Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nFollowing his instincts, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable roared towards the sky, but he saw that these meteors flew past him without landing on him at all!\n\nCountless meteors flew across the battlefield, descending rapidly.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s expression turned colder as her eyes sparked like lightning, Star Constellation Chessboard appeared above her head.\n\nA large number of pieces flew out of the chessboard and hit the flaming meteors rapidly, destroying them.\n\nFang Yuan was confused: “Star Constellation, what are you doing?! These flaming meteors are very useful to me, I have a second move to use with them.”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable gritted her teeth: “If I did not stop them, these meteors would have pierced the heavenly wind qi wall and landed in Central Continent.”\n\nFang Yuan smiled coldly: “Star Constellation, we are trying to kill a venerable, are you unwilling to pay a small price like this? If this happened in Eastern Sea, I would not have interfered. With this level of sincerity, you think we can kill Spectral Soul Demon Venerable today?”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable stared at Fang Yuan: “Fang Yuan, don’t go overboard! Among the three of us, who do you think has the least sincerity?”\n\nFang Yuan’s expression also turned cold: “Star Constellation, do you think I am such a person? To kill Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, I gave you multiple Immortal Gu and even lost my heaven form killer move!”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable were speechless.\n\nIt was clearly Fang Yuan’s poor planning that got him targeted, he was too weak and unable to protect his rank nine killer move, but now, from his tone, he wanted to seek compensation from them?\n\nHow could that be possible!\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable spoke: “Fang Yuan, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable is targeting you. The two of us are helping you to deal with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable now.”\n\nBut Fang Yuan laughed heartily: “Do I need your help? I can easily take care of this. You two can return to Longevity Heaven and Heavenly Court, I will fight against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable in Central Continent and Northern Plains to the best of my abilities, and I will take his life in the end. Just Spectral Soul alone is nothing to fear!”"
