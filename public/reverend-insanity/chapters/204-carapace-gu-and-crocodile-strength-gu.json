Using primeval stones to recover their primeval essence, Bai Ning Bing’s method of facing them head on and lasting until now, was already outstanding.\n\nIf a Gu Master’s primeval essence runs dry, their battle strength will drop down to rock bottom.\n\nBai Ning Bing started to look back at the cliff behind her, wondering if there was a way to escape.\n\nWhen she saw Fang Yuan’s casual expression while he was leaning against the cliff, she flew into a rage, scolding, “Fang Yuan, I fight at the front lines, yet you watch the show behind me?!”\n\nFang Yuan snorted, “The former Northern Dark Ice Soul physique, the grand Bai Ning Bing, can’t even deal with a hundred beast group?”\n\nBai Ning Bing was exasperated, “If you have the guts, then you go and fight!”\n\nFang Yuan laughed coldly, “If I had Rank three cultivation, it is enough to eliminate all these six legged crocodiles, why would I need you?”\n\nBai Ning Bing breathed loudly, smoke coming out of her pores.\n\nFang Yuan said seriously, “Bai Ning Bing, I can tell you’re used to fighting without restrain. You are a former Northern Dark Ice Soul physique, but now that you are A grade with 90%, if you still keep fighting like that your primeval essence will definitely be insufficient. An outstanding Gu Master will use their primeval essence in the most efficient way, never wasting a drop. From now on, battle according to my instructions. Your fighting method is too crude, you have to be more meticulous now.”\n\n“Huh?” Bai Ning Bing’s lips twitched, “My battle method isn’t meticulous enough? Do you know how many times the clan leader and elders praised me, for being the number one skillful fighter in Bai clan?!”\n\n“What’s there to compare with a bunch of scrubs? Listen closely…”\n\nBai Ning Bing laughed coldly three times, but Fang Yuan continued talking.\n\nHis voice entered Bai Ning Bing’s ears; at first she was indifferent, but eventually, her expression changed.\n\nIt went from disdain to seriousness, and finally, turning grave.\n\nFang Yuan’s words hit the nail right on the head. There was profound meaning in every word, perfectly describing her inability!\n\nThis was the collection of his 500 years of life, the essence left behind through the accumulation of time. How could it not let this youngster, naive and innocent, be extremely shocked?\n\nFang Yuan lived for 500 years, so he was as sly as a fox. His experience was something not even First gen Gu Yue or Sky Crane Lord could match with.\n\nThese two old geezers lived for almost a thousand years, but most of their life was spent in deep sleep, retaining that last breath of theirs. Their true “living” phase, was merely two to three hundred years at most.\n\nIf it was any other time, Bai Ning Bing upon hearing Fang Yuan’s advice, would merely take it as a joke. She was a proud arrogant genius, even if she was shocked, she would not follow suit. But now, facing the crocodiles’ pressure, her body could not help but execute what he said, and it showed an immediately effect.\n\nSix legged crocodiles continued to die, but her situation improved by leaps and bounds.\n\nHer primeval essence and stamina were depleted, but once she started using them carefully and reduced her meaningless attacks while increasing her attack effectiveness, it caused her primeval essence and stamina to slowly recover amidst battle.\n\nFifteen minutes later, after at least half the pack of six legged crocodiles were injured and over two hundred corpses on the ground, they finally stopped attacking and started to retreat.\n\nSoon after, a large body appeared from under the water.\n\nIt had two rows of sharp blade-like teeth. Its yellow vertical pupils reflected Bai Ning Bing’s body as it emitted a cold killing intent.\n\nThis was the six legged crocodile king.\n\nHundred beast king level, Grand Crocodile king!\n\nDifferent from other six legged crocodiles, this crocodile king was larger like a yak, and it did not stand on six legs, but only moved with its two hind legs.\n\nIt walked like humans, with a back as thick as a bear, and a scaly tail dragging a line across the beach.The other four feet that were free, were in a claw shape. Resembling four arms, they were thick and the muscles were tough as rocks.\n\nBai Ning Bing could not help but laugh bitterly.\n\nIf she was fighting this hundred beast king alone, she could win. But now that she had undergone an intense battle and there was little primeval essence and stamina left in her, she could not deal with this hundred beast king who was in perfect condition.\n\nBut at this time, Fang Yuan’s voice came from behind her, “Catch.”\n\nA blue and white light entered her aperture, turning into a lotus and rooting deep into her aperture sea.\n\nImmediately, her primeval sea level started rising!\n\nBai Ning Bing was surprised and overjoyed: “What Gu is this?”\n\n“Heavenly Essence Treasure Lotus.” Fang Yuan said.\n\n“So this is the Heavenly Essence Treasure Lotus! No wonder First gen Gu Yue wanted it.” Bai Ning Bing sighed again, then scolded, “You have such a Gu, why didn’t you lend it to me earlier?”\n\nFang Yuan chuckled, talking while minding his own business, “Thankfully this is only a hundred beast king. Remember, its weakness is that white skin near the chest.”\n\nSaying so, his body faded like ripples on the water surface, and he slowly vanished.\n\nHe activated the Stealth scale Gu.\n\n“Scheming and cunning!” Bai Ning Bing scolded, before focusing her gaze on the Grand Crocodile king.\n\nOnly to see that on its chest, there was indeed a white skin, but it was only face- sized, and was protected by its four limbs. How could she strike that area easily?\n\nHowl!\n\nThe Grand Crocodile king growled, before rushing at Bai Ning Bing.\n\nBai Ning Bing could only rely on herself and roll around desperately, evading the hits and flicking her wrist at the same time.\n\nChainsaw Golden Centipede smashed on the Grand Crocodile king’s back.\n\nSparks flew as the Chainsaw Golden Centipede was rebounded, almost causing Bai Ning Bing to trip from the impact.\n\nThere was a white scratch on the Grand Crocodile king’s back armor, but other than that it was unfazed.\n\nHowl!\n\nIt swung its tail, and winds flew.\n\nBai Ning Bing only saw a black whip approaching, thick, large and long. She could not evade it, so she was only able to activate the Sky Canopy Gu.\n\nWith a bang, she was sent flying, landing tens of metres away. Afterwards, she slammed on the tough sturdy cliff walls.\n\nBai Ning Bing was in so much pain until she drew a deep breath. Sky Canopy Gu is a Rank three Gu, having great defense but it could not reduce the force from impacts.\n\nBambambam…\n\nThe Grand Crocodile king’s thick strong legs left a strong imprint on the beach as it charged towards Bai Ning Bing.\n\nBai Ning Bing’s eyes shone; seeing the Grand Crocodile king’s attack, she did not move.\n\nThe Grand Crocodile king came crashing with its imposing aura, flashing its claws. If it was any other person, they would be scared shitless or run away in fear, but Bai Ning Bing was after all Bai Ning Bing, possessing an iron will.\n\n“Twenty steps, fifteen steps, ten steps, five steps!” Seeing the Grand Crocodile king was near, at the final moment, Bai Ning Bing leapt.\n\nBam!\n\nShe narrowly evaded the Grand Crocodile king, and the latter crashed into the cliff walls, as large amount of debris fell and buried it.”A beast is a beast after all!” Bai Ning Bing laughed loudly, about to chase after it, but suddenly thought of something and stopped.\n\nThe next moment, the Grand Crocodile king’s tail swept and sent the debris flying all over the place.\n\nBai Ning Bing observed silently, and a moment later the crocodile king finally got free.\n\nIt was in a desperate state. Half its teeth were broken and blood flowed out of its nostrils; its golden pupils also turned red.\n\nIt growled furiously at the sky and lowered its body, rushing towards Bai Ning Bing at an even faster speed.\n\nBai Ning Bing retreated, smiling as she dodged.\n\nBam!\n\nWith a huge bang, the cliff walls collapsed, and smoke flew everywhere……\n\nAn hour later, the injured Grand Crocodile king covered its white skin in futile, as blood continued to ooze out of its wounds.\n\nSoon after, it plopped on the ground, on the beach that was completely wrecked by the battle.\n\n“This Blood Moon Gu is pretty useful huh. With that bleeding effect, I can kill that Grand Crocodile king so easily.” Bai Ning Bing looked at the red moon insignia, thinking in her mind.\n\nAfter the crocodile king died, the remaining hundred six legged crocodiles lost their drive and morale, escaping into the river one by one.\n\n“Finally over.” Bai Ning Bing shook the Chainsaw Golden Centipede on her hand away, sitting on the beach in exhaustion.\n\nFang Yuan’s figure came out of the shade, squatting at the crocodile king’s corpse and searching.\n\n“Found it!” When he took back his hand, there was one Gu in each of his palms.\n\nBai Ning Bing seeing this, breathed heavily in anger. She fought so intensely with the crocodile king, finally killing it and chasing the crocodile group away. But the unscathed Fang Yuan came out to collect the battle rewards instead.\n\nFang Yuan took a close look.\n\nThese two Gu, one was almost dying, but still struggling. It had a turtle shell, around palm-size, but its protruding surface was covered in crocodile scales.\n\nThe Carapace Gu.\n\nAnother was uninjured, but was not moving at all, letting Fang Yuan squish it with his fingers.\n\nThe Crcocodile Strength Gu.\n\nIt was very small, smaller than a finger. It was like a mini crocodile, with head, body and tail, but did not have any legs.\n\nBoth the Carapace Gu and the Crcocodile Strength Gu were Rank two Gu worms.\n\nNormally, hundred beast kings have Rank two Gu living in them. In the thousand beast king, there was Rank three, and in the myriad beast king there was Rank four.\n\n“As I expected.” Fang Yuan seeing the two Gu, did not feel strange. He was experienced and after observing the battle, he had seen through the crocodile king’s abilities.\n\nImmediately, he leaked a little of the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura, and refined these two Gu with his primeval essence instantly.\n\nThe Carapace Gu flew to Fang Yuan’s back, forming a large scale insignia, like a tattoo. It extended from Fang Yuan’s shoulder to his waist, covering his entire back.\n\nAs with the name, it was a Gu that could enhance the defense of a Gu Master’s back.\n\nCrcocodile Strength Gu turned into a dim yellow light, entering Fang Yuan’s aperture.\n\nIt was similar to the black and white boar Gu, able to increase the Gu Master’s strength permanently, by the strength of a crocodile! It had high market value, normally a precious Gu worm without any available in the market.\n\n“This again, instantly refining a Gu worm!” Seeing this, Bai Ning Bing could not continue but be furious, as her pupils dilated to pin-size.\n\nWhen she fought Fang Yuan earlier, she found this secret.\n\nBack at the clan, she searched the records and checked up on some assistance-type Gu that can achieve this effect.\n\nBut at this moment, as she witnessed the scene again, she felt that the truth might be different.\n\n“This guy has so many trump cards. Sky Canopy Gu, Blood Moon Gu and Chainsaw Golden Centipede aside, but even the Heavenly Essence Treasure Lotus! His battle tactics are also completely superior to the clan’s teachings. Also, what Gu did he use earlier?”\n\nThinking of this, a cold chill went down Bai Ning Bing’s spine."
