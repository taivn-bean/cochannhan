From your grandfather, father, and then you, you were all loyal Wu clan subjects! Now, the clan has a mission for you, this mission would need you to sacrifice your future, your reputation, and maybe even your life.”\n\n“Lord clan leader, I am willing to do it for the clan!”\n\n…\n\nIn the darkness, Wu Ran opened his eyes.\n\n” Huff …” He breathed out slowly, sitting up from his bed, muttering: “I dreamed again.”\n\nThis dream was not fake, but originated from the deepest part of his memory.\n\n‘Li Ran’ is his fake name, his real name is ‘Wu Ran’.\n\nThe surname Wu, bore great significance in southern border. It represented the number one overlord in the southern border, Wu clan!\n\nEleven years ago, Wu clan leader Empress Wu Ji gave an audience to Wu Ran, and assigned him a secret mission —\n\nMaking his way into Shang clan’s higher up level!\n\nFor this, he changed his name, and roamed the wilderness for three years before settling in Shang clan city.\n\nHe laid low for eight whole years.\n\n“It has been eight years, an entire eight years. Wu clan’s clansmen have mostly forgotten me by now huh? Wu Ran is dead, in this world, only Li Ran remains.”\n\nLi Ran sighed in his heart.\n\nHe had been lurking for too long. So long that he almost forgot his own name.\n\nHere, he wore a mask, living for eight years, pretending to be a libertine, an ordinary Gu Master of the lowest social level. Even to his beloved wife, he did not say a thing.\n\nDuring this period, he only left once every half a year to contact Wu clan. It had always been a one-sided contact, hiding all traces to the limit.\n\nUntil a year ago, the agent informed him that the clan was going to use him. His excitement then could not be expressed in words!\n\n“After eight years, they have finally activated it, everything will be different now!” Li Ran exclaimed. He willed, and a Gu appeared from his storage.\n\nThis fossil was cube shaped, like a brick shining with star light on its surface.\n\nThis was a stellar stone.\n\nIf Fang Yuan was here, he would find that this rock was very similar to the rock used as a leg support in the gambling den.\n\nLi Ran caressed this fossil gently, frowning slightly.\n\nAs a spy, he spent ten years lurking in the city, creating a perfect background for himself. It would definitely gain Shang clan’s trust.\n\nBut trust is not enough, he needed ability that surpasses the ordinary man, so that he can dominate the battle stage. Only then would Shang clan recruit him, and make him into an external clan elder like Wei Yang, thus gaining authority in Shang clan.\n\nThis ‘ability’ had to appear naturally, and it cannot be too abrupt.\n\nThus, Wu clan leader Empress Wu Ji chose a Gu worm for him personally.\n\nThis was a Gu that possessed a legendary tale.\n\nObtained from an ancient strength path inheritance, it is an almost extinct Gu in the current world, it was extremely rare!\n\nWith this Gu, Li Ran can emerge from his slumber and dominate the battle stage.\n\nAs to the method of ‘obtaining’ this Gu, to avoid suspicion, Wu clan had made preparations.\n\nThat is, gambling rocks.\n\nLuck is unpredictable, and an ancient Gu being sealed within a fossil was completely normal.\n\nThe demonic Gu Master Wei Shen Jing was a subordinate of Empress Wu Ji. Creating a fake scrap grade fossil was as easy as pie, no one would be able to discern it.\n\nLi Ran spent some effort too.\n\nTo make sure people believed this was a fossil from the gambling den, and not his own, he chose a gambling rock that was used as leg support in the gambling den.\n\nThis rock was there for many years, people walked about and never noticed it.\n\nLi Ran had communicated with Wu clan, asking Wei Shen Jing to create a similar stellar stone.\n\nLater in his plan, he would swap this rock with the stellar stone in his hand without anyone noticing. He was a Gu Master, after observing for half a year, he knew when was the perfect time to swap the stones without anyone realizing.\n\nWhen he finally opens the stellar stone, the entire gambling den would testify for him, that it was completely due to luck.\n\nAfter he obtains this Gu, he would turn over a new leaf, and start the story of a prodigal son. He would rise up, find his wife and child, and become an external clan elder of Shang clan. He would complete his mission, and bring his wife and child back to Wu clan, where they belong.\n\nThinking of his wife and son, Li Ran felt extremely guilty.\n\nHe loved his wife deeply, she is so kind, so strong willed.\n\nAt the same time, as a father, he would love to give everything good in this world to his son.\n\nHe was only making use of her at the start, but as time went on, their relationship deepened, and he could not stop loving her. After their son was born, his love for them only grew. But eventually, because of his mission and secret identity, he had to temporarily leave them.\n\n“You must hate me now, I’ve disappointed you too much. But it is alright, soon, soon. I have been deployed, I can bring you happiness!”\n\nLi Ran gripped his fists, his eyes shining with determination.\n\nTomorrow, he would go to the battle stage, and engage in a battle. The day after, he would bring this stellar stone to the gambling den, and perform his life changing show.\n\n“I had planned to use that stone as a cover, but life is hard to predict, someone actually chose it. Heh, that idiot, choosing a scrap grade stellar stone. But… tomorrow, I will have to be an idiot too.”\n\nLi Ran laughed, keeping the stellar stone back into his storage Gu.\n\nAlthough there was some changes to his plans, it was still fine. He had planned for such a small accident anyway.\n\nHe laid down once more, and soon, fell into deep sleep.\n\nThis time, he did not have any dreams.\n\nOn the second day, he felt great, energetic and full of hope.\n\nHe felt that he was like a tourist walking in a dark cavern. After a long journey, he finally saw the light ahead, the exit of the cavern!\n\nEight years of enduring, everything would become so wonderful!\n\nEverything would definitely become perfect!\n\nWith such a belief, he arrived at the battle stage.\n\nHe had gotten information of the opponent this time, a rank two peak stage Gu Master often seen in fifth inner city’s battle stage, he was a familiar face.\n\nEven the weakest Gu Master, if they can roam in the battle stage without giving up, they have the ability to hold their own.\n\nLi Ran did not look down on his opponent, the Gu Li Ran currently had were quite weak and not considered high quality. He had to conceal himself as well, unable to fight fiercely, thus, this battle could go either way.\n\nIndeed, as they fought, it was as Li Ran predicted.\n\nFrom probing to fighting, the two were evenly matched, at a stalemate.\n\nThe battlefield was ravaged, and the few spectators gasped at the scene.\n\nSuddenly, Li Ran’s eyes shone brightly.\n\nA chance!\n\nHe found a weak point of his opponent, and was about to attack.\n\nSuddenly, his heart hurt, and his body stiffened; the counter attack from his opponent sent him flying.\n\nLi Ran was heavily injured, groaning in pain. His body flew more than ten steps back, until he stopped himself.\n\nA trace of blood fell from his mouth.\n\nHowever, the severity of his injuries was on par with the shock and fear in his heart right now!\n\n“My flowerbud Gu, my flowerbud Gu! How did it lose connection with me? The stellar stone is inside it!!”\n\nAt the same time, at Li Ran’s residence.\n\nThe bed was flipped over, showing a secret compartment.\n\nFang Yuan stood beside it, holding a flowerbud Gu in his hand.\n\nThis Gu was rank two, used to store items. It was shaped like a flower, light blue in color but was crystal in material, shining clearly under sunlight.\n\nAlthough it was Li Ran’s Gu, with the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura, Fang Yuan instantly refined it.\n\nFang Yuan’s mind went into the Gu, and saw many things inside. A large sack of rice, some daily necessities, a poor quality block of compressed tea, thirty to forty primeval stones and a few fossils.\n\n“This is it!” Fang Yuan’s heart trembled, as he activated his primeval essence, and a black light flew out of the flowerbud Gu.\n\nThe black light landed in Fang Yuan’s palm, turning into a stellar stone.\n\nIt looked extremely ugly, squarish and resembled a brick, almost the same as the leg support rock.\n\nThe moment the stellar stone appeared, the entire world seemed to have went silent.\n\nFang Yuan’s pupils expanded.\n\nThump thump… thump thump…\n\nHis heartbeat accelerated, he could clearly hear it.\n\nIncluding this shabby house and the people walking outside, the surroundings faded away; only Fang Yuan and the stellar stone were left.\n\nHe held the heavy stellar stone, and he could feel the cold surface of the rock.\n\nFang Yuan stared at it passionately, at the same time, his lips curled up as he smiled.\n\nHis smile widened, until he opened his mouth and laughed silently!\n\nThe legendary Gu, is finally in my hands!!!\n\nHe screamed in his heart: “Just as I guessed, this Li Ran is a spy from another clan! When I was at Qing Mao mountain, I used the gambling rock to conceal my liquor worm, he is doing the same thing. No wonder the stellar stone was empty, my previous life’s rumor was all part of his act.”\n\n“Today, he is going to the battle stage to fight. Whether he concealed his strength or not, according to his previous records, the opponent is around the same level as him, it would be a tough fight. The legendary Gu’s stellar stone is so important, it will be tough to fight if he brings it around. With his vigilant nature, he would not hide the stellar stone in the storage Gu and bring it around.”\n\nBecause if he lost the battle, his opponent would get to take one of his Gu worms.\n\nHe knew there was a legendary Gu within the stellar stone, if his opponent took his storage Gu, he would lose the stellar stone!"
