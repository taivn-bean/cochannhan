Each of the Hei tribe Gu Immortals went to an area and defended territory.\n\nWith Gu Immortals here, the second line of defense stabilized, they were hard to deal with.\n\nThis made many Gu Immortals who invaded Hei tribe furious.\n\nRuining a person’s wealth was like killing their parents!\n\nThis hatred was huge, and because Hei tribe was weak, they lost their only Immortal Gu House Dark Prison, the only problem was Green City Rampage. But in this situation, Hei tribe was only struggling at death’s door.\n\n“I’ll fight you!” Pi Shui Han pounced.\n\nHe waved his hand, as tides began to form, charging towards Hei Tie Sheng.\n\nThe tides flew into the air and stopped, turning into glaciers as the temperature fell.\n\n“Be careful, this is Pi Shui Han’s signature killer move — Flood Glacier!” A rank six Gu Immortal from Hei tribe shouted.\n\nHei Tie Sheng laughed lightly, he and Pi Shui Han had deep enmity too, he was not surprised that Pi Shui Han attacked him.\n\n“He is just a loser, so what?” Hei Tie Sheng’s eyes shined with dark light, he did not move, he only looked over.\n\nThe white glacier was covered with black water, in a few breaths’ time, it disintegrated.\n\nPi Shui Han grunted, spitting out a mouthful of blood, falling from the sky.\n\n“Against so many enemies, consecutive killer moves are not easy to use.” A figure appeared behind Hei Tie Sheng.\n\nIt was Huang Di!\n\nThis was the rank seven demonic path Gu Immortal who communicated with the other demonic path members, entering Iron Eagle blessed land first and causing the righteous path to lose the initiative.\n\nHe had earned immensely, right now, he was using the chance to attack and kill Hei Tie Sheng!\n\nHei Tie Sheng did not move, he did not even turn around, he only waved his sleeves.\n\nImmediately, dark light burst out like waves, sending Huang Di far away.\n\nHuang Di struggled to get out of the black tide, showing shock on his face. His seven orifices were spewing out black blood, he drilled into the ground without even a bit of hesitation, vanishing.\n\n“Simply a rat, what can you do?” Hei Tie Sheng snorted, looking around, shouting: “Who is next?”\n\nNobody came.\n\nHei Tie Sheng had incredible battle strength, he was even stronger than Pi Shui Han.\n\nThe immortals could tell, this person was prepared to die, he was oozing with fighting intent and was fighting without reservation, in this situation, his battle strength was at its peak.\n\nWhy did everyone come to Iron Eagle blessed land?\n\nTo gain fortune!\n\nIf their goal was fortune, why would they fight with this person to the death?\n\nThe Gu Immortals moved away, evading Hei Tie Sheng.\n\nBattle commenced.\n\nOne side was the collaboration of righteous and demonic, they had great numbers, but Hei tribe had the territorial advantage and large numbers of desolate beast resonance eagles to help them.\n\nBattles raged on.\n\nHei tribe’s Gu Immortals were all prepared to die defending their home, their battle intent was high.\n\nThe demonic path Gu Immortals just wanted a fortune, they did not want to die, they were heavily restricted.\n\nThe intelligence of Gu Immortals could not be matched by iron crown eagles.\n\nAt once, the second line of defense was extremely stable!\n\nHei Tie Sheng saw that everyone was avoiding him, so he approached them instead.\n\n“Meng Ji, hand over your life!” Hei Tie Sheng shouted angrily, pouncing towards the Meng tribe rank seven Gu Immortal who was closest to him.\n\n“Hmph, would I be afraid of you?” Meng Ji fought back courageously.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nThe two fought as the sky rumbled, intense shock waves were sent out.\n\nAfter several rounds, the proud and arrogant Meng Ji turned around and fled.\n\nHe was courageous, but Hei Tie Sheng was beyond courageous, he was a lunatic not afraid of death!\n\nHe fought with Meng Ji by causing injuries to both of them, he was trying to go down together.\n\nAfter several times, Meng Ji could not stand it anymore, he immediately retreated.\n\nHei Tie Sheng was going to chase him, but he heard the Hei tribe Gu Immortals cry for help, he turned around to help them out.\n\n“Guan Chou, take this!” Hei Tie Sheng charged forward, dark light burst out and engulfed the surroundings.\n\nGuan Chou was a transformation path Gu Immortal, he had turned into a lion. He roared as he crashed into Hei Tie Sheng.\n\nAt the next moment, the lion that Guan Chou had transformed into flew out like a rag doll.\n\nHei Tie Sheng charged at him again.\n\nGuan Chou screeched, turning into a little bird and flying away.\n\n“Coward!” Hei Tie Sheng could not catch up, he snorted.\n\nHis gaze swept around, he targeted the rank seven Gu Immortal who was closer to him, Liu Zhuan Shen.\n\nLiu Zhuan Shen was very perceptive!\n\nSeeing that Hei Tie Sheng was approaching, he retreated.\n\nHei Tie Sheng chased after him, so Liu Zhuan Shen went over to Divine Lord Tian Du.\n\nDivine Lord Tian Du’s body shook, he turned around and left.\n\nLiu Zhuan Shen then lured Hei Tie Sheng towards Unfettered Scholar, he snorted as a three-way battle started.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nA moment later, in an intense clash, Liu Zhuan Shen and Unfettered Scholar were forced back.\n\nHei Tie Sheng continued to fight everyone, he was unstoppable.\n\nIn the sky, Hei tribe’s first supreme elder sighed: “Tie Sheng, this child…”\n\nHe knew that Hei Tie Sheng had a special technique, he could expend his lifespan to increase the power of his killer moves.\n\nHe was fighting by consuming his life!\n\nThe righteous and demonic Gu Immortals did not want to die, that was true. But with just this reason, there was no way anybody could contest him.\n\nHei Tie Sheng was a huge setback to the Gu Immortals.\n\nThese were all people with high cultivation level and impressive methods. In the earlier battles, the weaker Gu Immortals were already eliminated.\n\nBut no matter how strong Hei Tie Sheng was, he could not reach the level of rank eight.\n\nHe could not turn around the situation singlehandedly.\n\nResonance eagles were captured or killed, while Hei tribe’s Gu Immortals died one by one.\n\nFight!\n\nA fight to the death!\n\nTowards the end of the battle, Hei Tie Sheng was the only one left.\n\nHe was bathed in blood, he stood proud and straight, looking at the Gu Immortals around, he laughed loudly: “Alright, come and kill me!”\n\nThe immortals looked around, but nobody moved.\n\nLiu Zhuan Shen’s expression was complex, he knew that Hei Tie Sheng was already out of steam. His immortal essence was expended, he was not a threat.\n\nBut he was unable to attack!\n\nHei Tie Sheng moved his lips: “Then let me!”\n\nSaying so, he charged towards the Gu Immortals in front.\n\nCharge!\n\nHis final charge.\n\nHe died while charging.\n\nIt was tragic.\n\nIt was courageous.\n\nHei Tie Sheng died, the immortals had no obstacles left, they went towards Hei tribe’s final line of defense.\n\nTwelve flying eagles blocked them.\n\nEnemy eagles with overflowing killing intent, absolute eyebrow eagles with divine aura, shadow eagles with indistinct figures, whale swallowing eagles with huge muscular bodies…\n\nWithout exception, they were all ancient desolate beasts, having rank seven battle strength.\n\nHei tribe’s first supreme elder and the other six elders descended from the sky.\n\nAt this moment, they no longer placed further hope in being saved, they came out to battle.\n\nAncient battle formation, Green City Rampage!\n\nThe top four supreme elders joined forces, their might could rival rank eight Gu Immortals.\n\nThe righteous and demonic Gu Immortals split up at once.\n\nResources were more important.\n\nBy now, everyone had already earned a lot, but they paid a huge price too. Their mental energy was depleted, their immortal essence was also expended, who would fight against Green City Rampage in this state?\n\nWhoever got caught would simply be unlucky!\n\nIn the sky of Iron Eagle blessed land, there were twelve eagle nests that were in peculiar shapes.\n\nThese eagle nests were not round ball wooden eagle nests, they held precious rank eight immortal materials.\n\nImmediately, countless Gu Immortals fought over them.\n\nThe battle was a chaotic mess!\n\nGreen City Rampage went on a killing spree, lots of unlucky people died in the top four supreme elders’ hands.\n\nHumans die for wealth and birds die for food.\n\n“This is too dangerous, let’s go, let’s go.” Nian Er Fu grabbed the unconscious Nian Er Ping Zhi as he sneakily retreated.\n\n“I cannot stay here.” Pi Shui Han also retreated, he had obtained some eagle nests, and had gained large amounts of rank eight immortal materials.\n\nSome astute Gu Immortals were leaving.\n\nThe twelve eagle nests were all lost.\n\nSuddenly, in the air, there were ripples as a thirteenth eagle nest appeared, drawing everyone’s attention.\n\nThe immortals shouted, pouncing over.\n\n“This is mine.” Chu Du suddenly appeared, blocking all the immortals.\n\n“Ah, Domination Immortal!” The immortals were shocked, stopping their movement.\n\nChu Du was powerful, far stronger than Hei Tie Sheng!\n\nLiu tribe’s entire strength as a super force could do nothing to him. In the entire Northern Plains Gu Immortal world, only people like Qin Bai Sheng could fight him.\n\nAt this stage in the battle, everyone was in poor conditions.\n\nBut this was the first time Chu Du was acting.\n\nAt once, nobody dared to go forward.\n\nChu Du successfully deterred the immortals, it was to obtain this mysterious thirteenth eagle nest.\n\nGreen City Rampage came crashing, a voice was loud as thunder: “Chu Du, you dare?”\n\nChu Du laughed coldly: “Why wouldn’t I?”\n\nBoom!\n\nThe two sides clashed, the giant that Green City Rampage transformed into was sent flying by Chu Du in one move.\n\n“The ancient battle formation is powerful, but it is powered by you people. In your condition, none of you can match me.” Chu Du stood arrogantly in the air, looking at the immortals.\n\nThe immortals wanted to attack, but they also wanted others to do the work, so that they could reap the benefits.\n\n“Simply a mob.” Chu Du commented, before going ahead to grab at the eagle nest behind him.\n\nSuddenly, a shocking change occurred.\n\nAn Immortal Gu House appeared, crashing towards Chu Du’s head.\n\n“Modest Thatched Hut!” A Gu Immortal yelled, he recognized that this was Dong Fang tribe’s former Immortal Gu House!\n\n“Scram!” Chu Du slapped, creating a huge sound.\n\nThud!!\n\nBam, Modest Thatched Hut was actually sent flying by his slap.\n\nGasp!\n\nEveryone took in a deep breath of shock.\n\nChu Du successfully placed the thirteenth eagle nest into his own immortal aperture.\n\nNext, his gaze fell on Green City Rampage.\n\nThe four supreme elders felt a wave of despair.\n\n“Wait.” Just as Chu Du was about to deal the killing blow, a voice resounded in the entire place.\n\nAn immeasurable aura, like a formless mountain, enveloped the entire area in an instant.\n\nRank eight Gu Immortal, Heavenly Lord Bai Zu!\n\nThe immortals were shaken, the identity of the voice appeared in their minds.\n\nAt this point in the battle, a rank eight Gu Immortal had finally shown up!\n\nIt was not certain that he came in person, after all, only his voice was heard.\n\n“Wasn’t it agreed upon that the rank eight great experts would not personally interfere?” Some righteous path Gu Immortals who knew some inside information were confused.\n\nAt the next moment, the immortals heard Heavenly Lord Bai Zu’s voice: “Hei tribe’s battle ends here, the remaining members of Hei tribe have submitted to me. From now on, this is Bai Zu tribe’s territory.”\n\n“We are willing to change our surnames to Bai Zu!” Hei tribe’s elders responded.\n\nThe immortals were shaken, this matter was huge, the situation in Northern Plains’ Gu Immortal world would immediately change!\n\nSmarter people knew: Heavenly Lord Bai Zu could say this because he had come to an agreement with the other rank eight great experts.\n\n“No need to leave, I am holding a banquet for three days and three nights for everyone.” Heavenly Lord Bai Zu said again.\n\nThe remaining Hei tribe Gu Immortals’ faces twitched.\n\nThis battlefield which was still filled with blood from the battle earlier was going to hold a banquet. The change was too sudden and abrupt.\n\n“Congratulations to Bai Zu tribe, congratulations to Heavenly Lord.” The righteous path Gu Immortals quickly came to an agreement, giving many responses.\n\nThe demonic path and lone immortals were uneasy and agitated.\n\n“Hmph!” Chu Du snorted coldly, it was loud and shrill.\n\nHe left with a billowing of his sleeves.\n\nUnder everyone’s gazes, he flew away into the horizon."
