  "content": "Chapter 932: Yaksha Octopuses, Mouth Earthworm\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nWithout speaking, Fang Yuan and the other immortal zombies had already traveled more than a hundred and thirty kilometers down into Earth Trench.\n\nEven though they avoided battles, they still engaged in sixteen fights, both big and small.\n\nThe immortal zombies were more or less injured to an extent.\n\n“We can’t go any deeper.” Dragon Commander Ye Cha said: “At this depth, we are already at the range of the earth shell snail’s habitat, let’s look around.”\n\nNorthern Plains Zombie Alliance only managed to explore one hundred and sixty kilometers into Earth Trench.\n\nRight now, they were still around thirty kilometers from that limit, but the lower they went, the more dangerous it became, desolate beasts were everywhere, and Fang Yuan’s group would face even more difficulties than now.\n\nNo immortal zombie objected to Dragon Commander Ye Cha’s suggestion.\n\nAfter choosing a direction, everyone flew quietly.\n\nMaybe it was because Fang Yuan had used time assist luck before this trip and raised his luck for a period of time. But in any case, not long after, he encountered an earth shell snail.\n\n“Great.” Fang Yuan showed an overjoyed expression.\n\n“Don’t be anxious, check the surroundings first, make sure there are no dangers lurking around.” Dragon Commander Ye Cha was very patient.\n\nThe immortals used their methods to thoroughly investigate, in this area, there was a sizable group of yaksha octopuses guarding their territory.\n\n“To process the snail mucus, I will need to use starlight, it will definitely alert these yaksha octopuses.” Fang Yuan showed a difficult expression as he looked at Dragon Commander Ye Cha.\n\nEveryone’s expressions sank.\n\n“Why didn’t you say that earlier?” Landlord Lei Yu asked unhappily.\n\n“Maybe there is a way to conceal this disturbance…” Doctor Yin Xuan said.\n\nFang Yuan shook his head: “That is not possible, I also want to conceal our disturbance, but that is beyond my ability. I cannot reveal my actual method, but in short, we should get rid of these yaksha octopuses first.”\n\nFang Yuan’s attitude was firm and his reason was valid.\n\nThe other immortal zombies looked at each other, in the end, Dragon Commander Ye Cha relented: “Then we will fight this group of yaksha octopuses before Xing Xiang Zi starts.”\n\nThis time, Dragon Commander Ye Cha did the scouting personally.\n\nThere were eight desolate beast octopuses in this group, among them was an octopus king, having rank seven Gu Immortal battle strength.\n\n“Lin Da Niao will be in charge of the surroundings, mobilizing the bird groups to encircle the octopus group.”\n\n“Granny Yuan will draw their attention and distract them.”\n\n“Landlord Lei Yu and I will attack these octopuses.”\n\n“As for Doctor Yin Xuan, you will stand guard outside in case of emergencies.”\n\nDragon Commander Ye Cha quickly arranged matters, Fang Yuan did not have to do anything.\n\nThe yaksha octopuses were truly unfortunate, the immortal zombies stealthily approached them, scheming against this unknowing group. Thus, once they fought, the yaksha octopus group suffered a huge blow and fell into panic.\n\nThe immortal zombies quickly gained an advantage as they built upon their superiority.\n\nSoon, the battle reached its end as the octopuses were killed, only two were left.\n\nAt this time, Dragon Commander Ye Cha said to Fang Yuan: “Xing Xiang Zi, go ahead and attack.”\n\nFang Yuan’s gaze shone, he slowly went into battle.\n\nImmortal killer move — Star Snake Rope.\n\nHe first trapped the yaksha octopus that was in better condition, before using six illusion star bodies to encircle the other one.\n\nSwish swish swish…\n\nStarlight shone brightly, Fang Yuan attacked non-stop, he quickly killed this yaksha octopus which was already close to dying.\n\nNext, he turned around and targeted the final one remaining.\n\nThe yaksha octopus was half man and half beast. Its upper body was a muscular man with bulging muscles and dark skin that was tough as steel. Its lower body was made of dozens of tentacles, in place of legs.\n\nThis final yaksha octopus was in a good condition, it fought valiantly, engaging in a fierce battle with Fang Yuan, as it slowly fell into a deadlock with him.\n\nFang Yuan used star cloud grindstone to defend himself while waiting for a chance to attack time and time again, until he finally cut off all of the yaksha octopus’ tentacles.\n\nWhen he was fighting, the other immortal zombies watched without doing anything.\n\nAt most, Lin Da Niao manipulated the bird groups to prevent the yaksha octopus which was trying to escape from leaving, allowing Fang Yuan to catch up and continue fighting it.\n\nFang Yuan had a lot of patience, he slowly injured the yaksha octopus, dark and cold blood flowed out from its injuries.\n\n“Alright, you can stop.” Eventually, Dragon Commander Ye Cha did not want to wait anymore, he personally struck and captured this yaksha octopus himself.\n\nThe first few were all killed because they could not afford to go easy on the group initially.\n\nThis octopus was captured by Dragon Commander Ye Cha, he was preparing to raise it inside his immortal aperture.\n\nNow, all the immortal zombies understood Fang Yuan’s battle strength.\n\nFang Yuan only showed his star path battle strength, but even so, he was an expert among rank sixes. Landlord Lei Yu, who was unhappy towards Fang Yuan became silent.\n\nHe estimated that if he fought Fang Yuan alone, he might not be able to win.\n\nIn the Gu Immortal world, strength ruled above all, even if Landlord Lei Yu was unhappy, he could not show it on the surface.\n\nNext, Fang Yuan started collecting star night mucus.\n\nHe requested the immortal zombies to stay back and not use any investigative methods to steal his personal technique.\n\nThe immortal zombies were naturally unhappy, they scolded Fang Yuan internally for being so small-minded, but they had to agree to his request.\n\nWhen processing the mucus, the starlight caused quite a disturbance.\n\nSoon, the earth shell snail stopped moving, its entire body curled into its shell.\n\nThe moment it sensed danger, the earth shell snail would react like this.\n\nIts shell was very thick, even though it was only a desolate beast, most rank six Gu Immortals could do nothing to it. Even rank seven Gu Immortals would need to exert a lot of effort to break its shell.\n\nFurthermore, the earth shell snail was large like a whale, and heavy like a mountain, once it entered its shell, it could be for a year or two. If there was a huge commotion outside, it would stay inside for even longer.\n\nIf it was moved away from the habitat of earth shell snails, even if it was still in Earth Trench, even if it was outside of it by a few kilometers, the earth shell snail would die immediately.\n\nThus, the immortal zombies could only give up on this one and find others.\n\nIn Earth Trench, there were more than yaksha octopuses.\n\nThere were bat desolate beasts, wall climbing demon apes, and desolate plants like earth milk grass.\n\nOn their later journey, they met with three earth shell snails.\n\nAmong which, Fang Yuan made good use of two of them and collected a lot of star night mucus. The final one however, moved towards the territory of an ancient desolate beast red flame snake.\n\nThis monster had dark path, fire path, and earth path dao marks on it, it was hard to deal with and was an expert in digging holes, it could move quickly between the walls of Earth Trench.\n\nOnce they fought, the commotion would be unconcealable, thus, Fang Yuan and the others had to give up.\n\nUnder Fang Yuan’s intentional guidance, the immortal zombies got closer to his destination.\n\n“We’ve discovered a large number of yaksha octopuses ahead! Stop moving forward, there are a lot of them, the initial estimation is thirty!” Lin Da Niao suddenly reported anxiously.\n\n“Then we will leave this place and go in another direction.” Dragon Commander Ye Cha immediately ordered.\n\nThirty desolate beasts, that was the battle strength of thirty rank six Gu Immortals. Such a massive group would surely have at least three ancient desolate beast yaksha octopuses commanding it.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan was unwilling, he could not object to it publicly, he could only memorize this place for now.\n\nThe immortal zombies took a detour towards the south-east direction.\n\nSoon, they found a fourth earth shell snail.\n\nThis snail looked quite old, it was carrying a yellow shell, its white body moved slowly on the walls of Earth Trench, at an extremely slow pace.\n\n“We’re finally lucky.” After investigating, Lin Da Niao laughed: “This area has little danger, Sir Xing Xiang Zi can go ahead and collect the mucus.”\n\nFang Yuan nodded without speaking, observing intently.\n\nSuddenly, his eyes shined, he saw the danger in this place.\n\nThis place seemed safe, but it was full of earth path dao marks, once someone got close, they would be pulled towards the wall.\n\nThe heavier the body, the stronger the force of attraction.\n\n“Desolate beasts have huge bodies and incredible mass. Once they come here, they would be unable to move and would starve to death. The earth shell snail is heavy like a mountain, but this earth shell snail can still move slowly. It seems that this snail is not old, it is an ancient desolate beast earth shell snail!”\n\nRealizing this, Fang Yuan had an idea.\n\nHe flew over, purposely acting like he was sucked over, as he screamed.\n\n“Oh no, it is the gravity soil zone!”\n\n“This should only appear after a hundred and sixty kilometers in depth, it is actually here as well.”\n\n“Be careful! This gravity soil zone often has mouth earthworms hidden in ambush!”\n\nAt once, the immortal zombies shouted in shock.\n\nThe closer he was to the gravity soil zone, the more Fang Yuan felt the suction force getting stronger and his speed increased.’\n\nWith a loud thud, Fang Yuan crashed into the wall, his legs were deeply stuck in the wall as he showed a terrified expression.\n\nImmortal killer move — Star Fire Escape!\n\nFang Yuan used his movement killer move.\n\nImmediately, his body was covered in star fire as he flew.\n\n“Don’t fly!” Dragon Commander Ye Cha roared.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nWith a loud bang, a huge mouth earthworm emerged from the soil.\n\nThe earth shell snail immediately shrunk into its shell, turning motionless.\n\nHuge amounts of rocks were pushed away, the mouth earthworm opened its mouth, it could swallow four or five earth shell snails at once.\n\nFang Yuan screamed: “Someone save me!”\n\nOnce he said that, the mouth earthworm swallowed him.\n\n“Be careful! The mouth earthworm is full of sharp teeth, they are incomparably sharp!”\n\n“Hang in there, we will definitely rescue you!!”\n\nThe immortal zombies were panicking, they moved at once.\n\nIf anything happened to Fang Yuan, how would they explain themselves to Blazing Heaven Demoness?\n\nThey attacked fiercely, forcing the mouth earthworm back into the gravity soil zone immediately.\n\nThis mystical ancient desolate beast had a huge body when hunting for food. Once it ate, its body would shrink rapidly like a leaking balloon. The teeth inside it would rotate endlessly, grinding its prey into meat paste and blood.\n\nBut once Fang Yuan went inside, he used a star path killer move and stopped the body from shrinking.\n\nNext, he activated Fixed Immortal Travel.\n\nHe had memorized the place nearby earlier, in three breaths of time, Fixed Immortal Travel teleported him away and he escaped from this dangerous spot.\n\nBut Dragon Commander Ye Cha and the others still thought that Fang Yuan was inside the mouth earthworm, they were attacking it furiously.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan got away from the immortal zombies, the disturbance from Fixed Immortal Travel had attracted the huge group of yaksha octopuses.\n\nFang Yuan smiled, turning into a yaksha octopus and attacking furiously.\n\nA moment later, he successfully lured the angry yaksha octopuses towards Dragon Commander Ye Cha and the others.\n\nDragon Commander Ye Cha and the others were unable to discern Fang Yuan’s transformation, they thought the yaksha octopuses were fighting among themselves and were chasing away the weakest members.\n\nThey sighed over their bad luck but because Xing Xiang Zi was still inside the mouth earthworm, they could not leave.\n\nThus, the yaksha octopuses, the Northern Plains immortal zombies, and the mouth earthworm engaged in a chaotic battle."
