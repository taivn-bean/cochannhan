Because I added in many Gu worms of different types, many problems occurred. But this is already my current limit. To create a concise version, I will need years to deduce, or an increase in my attainment level once again.”\n\nFang Yuan knew that this myriad self second style had too many Gu worms involved, it was too complex and had many issues to deal with.\n\nWhile Fang Yuan was sighing at the difficult progress, the other Gu Immortals were filled with shock.\n\nEven though they did not speak, their gazes were flickering.\n\n“Liu Guan Yi, this fellow…”\n\n“Such fast progress! He could really mobilize Reverse Flow River.”\n\n“Unbelievable! Is he really human? He could achieve such progress in this short period of time.”\n\n“No, there is no way he can succeed. How can he really create an immortal killer move in such a short amount of time?”\n\nUndeniably, Fang Yuan’s rapid advancement had broken the common sense of these immortals.\n\nThey had never seen a person create an immortal killer move in such a short period of time and gain such rapid improvements through experimentation.\n\nBut right now, they were seeing it live.\n\nFang Yuan continued.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu and the dog tail life extending ferret, Mao Li Qiu, subconsciously increased their attacking power.\n\nBut Reverse Flow River was too huge, even after their endless attacks, they consumed less than five percent of the entire river.\n\n“Once more! Rise.” Fang Yuan had a serious expression, he grabbed at the air towards the river below him as he called out.\n\nThis time, the entirety of Reverse Flow River was affected, it was like a long dragon awakening from its slumber, it started to stretch its entire body freely.\n\n“How could this happen?!” Someone cried out subconsciously.\n\nThe entirety of Reverse Flow River started to fly in the sky like a rising dragon, ready to soar and roam the five regions and nine heavens.\n\n“Wishful thinking!” Old Ancestor Xue Hu shouted, slamming with his palms as an icy light shot out towards Reverse Flow River.\n\nReverse Flow River was hit and reflected it, the icy light seemed to have collided into a mirror, it was sent right back at him, in the blink of an eye, all of the vast surrounding grassland turned into an icy plain.\n\nFrost energy permeated, the sky was snowing, the temperature was falling.\n\nStrong winds blew intensely, the entire world seemed to have changed colors.\n\nThis was the power of a rank eight!\n\nFang Yuan could not help but feel shocked.\n\nHe was temporarily safe in Reverse Flow River, and the other Gu Immortals were protected by their rank eight existences.\n\nYing Wu Xie was covered in cold sweat, Purple Mountain True Monarch had awakened again at the crucial moment, if not for him, Ying Wu Xie and the rest would not have survived.\n\n“We will leave.” Purple Mountain True Monarch said.\n\n“But this…” Ying Wu Xie hesitated, but Purple Mountain True Monarch waved his hand and several rings of light appeared, capturing Ying Wu Xie and gang, sending them towards the sky.\n\nTo think that Shadow Sect was the first to retreat.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch left rapidly without saying a word, the Gu Immortals present were stunned.\n\n“Lord, that is the sovereign immortal aperture…” Ying Wu Xie was anxious, he transmitted to Purple Mountain True Monarch.\n\n“Don’t worry, I have already deduced that he won’t die! He can definitely escape.” Purple Mountain True Monarch said confidently.\n\nYing Wu Xie was not very convinced of Purple Mountain True Monarch’s words, but he could not express his doubts.\n\nBut at the next moment, he saw that all of Reverse Flow River started to glow in a bright blue light.\n\nBlue light flickered like rumbling clouds or raging currents.\n\nThe immortals’ gazes were all attracted to it.\n\nFang Yuan stood in the middle, great winds were blowing, causing his hair and sleeves to flutter in the sky.\n\nHis eyes were eerie, he said softly: “Rise.”\n\nInstantly, the river water surged and the immortals could hear the sounds of the waves, it resembled the roaring of a thousand men, the scene was domineering and grand.\n\nImmediately after, the blue light condensed, Reverse Flow River shrank, it became a tiny dot in an instant.\n\nThe huge Reverse Flow River vanished, it condensed towards Fang Yuan and turned into a light blue colored robe.\n\nThis long robe had wide sleeves, it was white like snow. On the surface of the robe, there was slow flowing water, it was the same appearance as Reverse Flow River earlier.\n\nNot just that, the surface of the white robe had faint mist surrounding it. There was also a strip of light that was deep azure, it was curvy and wavy, resembling a long sash, it coiled around Fang Yuan’s arms, the back of his neck, and around his waist again.\n\nImmortal killer move — Myriad Self Second Style — Reverse Flow Protection Seal, had been successfully activated at this moment!\n\n“He succeeded?!”\n\n“Impossible!”\n\n“He actually used Reverse Flow River to create a new immortal killer move in this short time?”\n\nThe immortals saw this and became tongue-tied, Old Ancestor Xue Hu was staring fiercely: “I refuse to believe this!”\n\nHe thrusted with his palms in Fang Yuan’s direction.\n\nImmediately, an icy light shot out at incredible speed towards Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan was prepared to face it.\n\nThe icy light landed on his body, but it was fully blocked by reverse flow protection seal.\n\nReverse flow protection seal flickered as the terrifying icy light was reflected back at its creator, Old Ancestor Xue Hu.\n\n“Success!” Fang Yuan’s heart was jumping, it gradually calmed down.\n\nEven though the immortal killer move was activated successfully, he needed to test it.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu’s attack confirmed that Fang Yuan’s reverse flow protection seal was incredibly powerful!\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu dodged the icy light, his expression turned ruthless and harsh as he looked at Fang Yuan.\n\n“Let me try.” Mao Li Qiu shouted.\n\nIts body vanished on the spot, at the next moment, it appeared behind Fang Yuan.\n\nIts ruthless claws were raised and they landed harshly.\n\nBoom!\n\nA loud sound could be heard, Fang Yuan flew out like a cannonball that was shot out.\n\nHis field of vision changed, Fang Yuan had landed on the ground a breath of time later.\n\nNext, with a loud explosion, a huge crater was formed on the icy ground.\n\nUnder everyone’s watchful gazes, Fang Yuan slowly stood up in the deep crater, he was expressionless and his body was intact, there was not even a graze on his skin!\n\nReverse flow protection seal had turned into a snow-white robe with an azure sash, there were almost no changes to it, but the mist on the surface of the robe had dissipated to a large extent. If one observed closely, the snow-white robe seemed to be covered in a layer of dust, it was no longer as bright as before.\n\nMao Li Qiu looked at Fang Yuan before turning to look at its claws.\n\nIts right paw was covered in blood, its flesh was exposed now!\n\nFang Yuan suffered no injuries, while Mao Li Qiu was quite severely injured.\n\n“Gasp…” Sounds could be heard coming from the Gu Immortals present.\n\n“What immortal killer move is this? Even Mao Li Qiu suffered a loss!!”\n\nSeeing this, even Bi Chen Tian’s eyes were twitching rapidly.\n\n“He actually did it!” Black Extremity was speechless, his expression was of utter shock.\n\n“Even an immemorial desolate beast’s physical attack was reflected back?” Old Ancestor Xue Hu frowned deeply.\n\n“How can this be?” Ying Wu Xie, who was far away in the sky, saw this and felt like he was dreaming.\n\nThere had never been a case where a rank eight Gu Immortal attacked a rank seven Gu Immortal and resulted in the rank seven Gu Immortal being unharmed, while the rank eight Gu Immortal was actually injured!\n\nRank eight and rank seven, the former always suppressed the latter.\n\nIn the last few thousand years, Feng Jiu Ge was the sole monster who had overwhelming talent, he was unparalleled and could battle rank eight existences.\n\nBut now, after Fang Yuan created myriad self second style, and successfully used it, Feng Jiu Ge no longer held this title alone.\n\nFrom now on, this supreme glory was shared with another person.\n\nLiu Guan Yi!\n\n“Central’s Feng Jiu Ge, North’s Liu Guan Yi…” Bu Zhen Zi muttered in a daze.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu smiled lightly: “Lad, I underestimated you after all.”\n\nHis arms were behind his back, he stopped attacking.\n\nBut Mao Li Qiu was furious: “Little lad, you are courting death, you dared to make me lose face!!”\n\nThe immemorial desolate beast attacked Fang Yuan furiously.\n\nFang Yuan was not its match, he was slammed away like a rubber ball.\n\nBut after dozens of blows, Fang Yuan was unharmed, he still had a pristine air, but Mao Li Qiu was panting roughly, bleeding profusely.\n\nEvery one of its attacks was reflected back at itself.\n\nMao Li Qiu was staring furiously, thinking: “This lad is a porcupine, I’m hurting myself, since when did Northern Plains have such a monster?”\n\nFang Yuan saw that Mao Li Qiu was at a loss against him and laughed, charging at the Central Continent Gu Immortals.\n\nCentral Continent’s Gu Immortals were like frightened birds, they dispersed at once.\n\nThe two Central Continent rank eights stayed and attacked Fang Yuan.\n\nBut it was no use!\n\nReverse flow protection seal was reflecting their attacks back at them, they landed on Mao Li Qiu, who was chasing after him.\n\nMao Li Qiu was suffering greatly, so angry it was about to blow up, it spat out a vast amount of purple light, its attack engulfed an enormous surrounding range.\n\nThis attack caused a huge battle.\n\nThe situation became chaotic, the Gu Immortals of all three sides were attacking.\n\nThis was the last thing Ying Wu Xie saw.\n\nHe was in deep admiration towards Purple Mountain True Monarch’s decision of retreating.\n\nAt the same time, he understood: After this battle, Liu Guan Yi’s name would spread throughout the five regions, it would shock the world, his reputation would rival Feng Jiu Ge!\n\nMore than ten days later, a figure in a sorry state passed the regional wall, arriving at Eastern Sea.\n\nIt was Fang Yuan.\n\n“I finally got free from that crazy animal.” Fang Yuan sighed deeply.\n\nMore than ten days ago, Old Ancestor Xue Hu, Central Continent’s Gu Immortals, and Longevity Heaven engaged in fierce combat, they fought with all they had.\n\nFang Yuan managed to escape from this chaotic battle, but Mao Li Qiu refused to stop chasing him.\n\nFang Yuan was not Mao Li Qiu’s match, but after he entered Northern Plains’ regional wall, Mao Li Qiu could only watch helplessly.\n\nIt was a wild beast born in Northern Plains, it was restricted by the regional wall.\n\nFang Yuan managed to escape from these pursuers.\n\n“Time to go back to Southern Border.” Fang Yuan did not stay, he flew into the clouds."
