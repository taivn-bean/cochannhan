Was Feng Jiu Ge really the only one sent after me?”\n\nFang Yuan was suspicious.\n\n“Forget it, I’ll ignore that for now.”\n\nFang Yuan calmed down and opened his immortal aperture’s entrance, letting out Hei Lou Lan, Bai Ning Bing, and the rest.\n\n“Next, I will use a killer move with Ying Wu Xie, our battle strength will fall, our safety will be in your hands.” Fang Yuan said to Bai Ning Bing, Lady White Rabbit, Fairy Miao Yin, and Hei Lou Lan.\n\nThe four immortals acknowledged it and moved out to patrol the surroundings.\n\nFang Yuan set up an immortal Gu formation.\n\nWith precaution Immortal Gu as the core, the entire Gu formation’s original form was a mortal formation from Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance.\n\nFang Yuan was a formation path grandmaster, it was not hard to modify a mortal formation. After adding in precaution Immortal Gu, the defense of this Gu formation could not be underestimated.\n\nOf course, there were weaknesses and flaws in this formation, but it was only needed for the time being.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance had four immortal Gu formations, the strongest one was purple blood river formation! Unfortunately, Fang Yuan lacked certain Immortal Gu for all of these immortal Gu formations, he could not set up any of them.\n\nIf the Gu formation was modified and used a vast number of mortal Gu to replace the missing Immortal Gu, the deduction would take two to three days.\n\nBecause of many reasons, Fang Yuan chose to set up this Gu formation.\n\nThis Gu formation was enough for now, it was to defend against sneak attacks from the enemies.\n\nMost importantly, Fang Yuan needed to race for time.\n\nHeavenly Court not sending any more pursuers instead made Fang Yuan more worried.\n\nThe Gu formation closed, creating a simple temporary space.\n\nThe Gu formation’s space was very simple, it could not compare to the Southern Border super Gu formation’s array of palaces.\n\nIn this empty space, there was only Fang Yuan and Ying Wu Xie.\n\n“Sect leader, let me do it! For Shadow Sect, for our goal, I will do my best!” Ying Wu Xie was filled with fighting spirit.\n\nFang Yuan nodded: “Then you can go first.”\n\nYing Wu Xie sat down and instilled his immortal essence.\n\nA moment later, his aura shook, immortal killer move burning soul bursting luck was successfully activated.\n\nAt once, Ying Wu Xie’s luck rose by many times, at the same time, he felt dizzy and nauseous.\n\nBurning soul bursting luck was a killer move that expended the foundation of the soul to temporarily increase the Gu Immortal’s luck. Thus, when the killer move activated, not only did Ying Wu Xie’s luck rise sharply, his soul was also extremely weakened.\n\nBut it was not a problem, Fang Yuan took out guts Gu.\n\nIn the process of cultivation, Fang Yuan had been accumulating his storage of guts Gu to prepare for the worst.\n\nHis vigilant act was very helpful to him, it was shown now when used on Ying Wu Xie.\n\nYing Wu Xie rapidly recovered, he was no longer dizzy, he was just a little pale.\n\nEven though his soul was healthy now, his soul path dao marks had reduced sharply.\n\nBurning soul bursting luck permanently used up soul path dao marks.\n\nAnd this killer move had requirements towards soul path dao marks, to activate it, one had to use a certain number of soul path dao marks.\n\nBecause of this, out of Fang Yuan’s side, only he and Ying Wu Xie were able to use this killer move.\n\nThe rest might have strong battle strength, but their soul foundation was weak.\n\nExperts had their field of expertise, not anyone could cultivate as widely as Fang Yuan. In fact, Fang Yuan could tackle so many paths because of the sovereign immortal body, and also because the dream realm raised his attainment level of many paths rapidly.\n\nAfter Ying Wu Xie, it was Fang Yuan’s turn.\n\nThis killer move, burning soul bursting luck, used the soul path Immortal Gu, Soul Howl. With Ying Wu Xie’s guidance, even though this was Fang Yuan’s first use, after failing twice, he succeeded in using it.\n\nRumble!\n\nInstantly, Fang Yuan witnessed a mirage, he could see the luck above his head surging and growing, soaring towards the heavens.\n\nHe nodded and informed Sixth Hair to refine Gu.\n\nSixth Hair and Ying Wu Xie had their luck connected.\n\nAnd before the battle of Reverse Flow River, while Fang Yuan was chasing Ying Wu Xie and the others, they had gone from Eastern Sea to Northern Plains.\n\nAnd in the Earth Trench in Northern Plains Zombie Alliance, Ying Wu Xie was aided by Sixth Hair to escape, while Sixth Hair used Dark Flow Giant City to obstruct Fang Yuan.\n\nYing Wu Xie and Sixth Hair had their luck connected at this time.\n\nNaturally, Ying Wu Xie still had connect luck Immortal Gu.\n\nTo delay Fang Yuan, Ying Wu Xie tried all kinds of ways to strengthen Sixth Hair. Luck was one aspect.\n\nOf course, in the end, Fang Yuan’s pursuit was stopped, and Sixth Hair did not die, he managed to return to Lang Ya blessed land safely.\n\nNow, Fang Yuan wanted to use this connection to raise Sixth Hair’s luck!\n\nInitially, when Ying Wu Xie was in Earth Abyss, he tried to use this move to refine Fixed Immortal Travel. Too bad Heavenly Court refined it first.\n\nBut his efforts were not in vain, it helped Fang Yuan to refine change form Immortal Gu.\n\nThis information was obtained by Fang Yuan from Purple Mountain True Monarch, he thought of using it in this situation.\n\nAfter all, luck was the best method to help in Gu refinement.\n\nThere was evidence of this.\n\nIn the past, it was because of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s luck path assistance that Long Hair Ancestor could refine so many Immortal Gu for him and create Eighty-Eight True Yang Building.\n\nPerceivable dao Immortal Gu!\n\nAfter using burning soul bursting luck, Fang Yuan used this Gu to inspect the number of soul path dao marks in his soul.\n\nThe numbers had truly been shaved off, his soul foundation was nearly crippled, he was back to square one.\n\nFang Yuan had cultivated his soul for a long time.\n\nWhen he acted as Chang Shan Yin and roamed Northern Plains, before joining the imperial court contest, he had already started. Using Luo Po Valley and Dang Hun Mountain, Fang Yuan’s current soul path cultivation was very efficient and fast.\n\nAfter a long period, his soul had accumulated a great number of soul path dao marks.\n\nBut today, after using burning soul bursting luck once, all of Fang Yuan’s effort had been obliterated.\n\nFang Yuan did not feel much of a pity or shame, he could always regain the dao marks later. But if he lost his life now, then it would all be over.\n\nIf other Gu Immortals like Bai Ning Bing tried to use this move, how could they have enough soul path dao marks for the expenditure?\n\nFang Yuan suddenly thought of something, asking Ying Wu Xie: “With your soul path foundation, how many times can you use it?”\n\nYing Wu Xie replied: “I can use it two more times, but sect leader, you have Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance, you should know that the same person cannot use burning soul bursting luck repeatedly to raise its effect. It is useless even if I try it again.”\n\nFang Yuan nodded: “I am just asking.”\n\nHe had a feeling of admiration towards Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\nYing Wu Xie was a split soul of Spectral Soul, but he actually had the soul foundation to use burning soul bursting luck four times.\n\nSpectral Soul was indeed the legendary person who created soul path and cultivated to rank nine!\n\n“Burning soul bursting luck has been activated, this is all we can do. Let’s go.” Fang Yuan settled his thoughts and stood up.\n\nSoon, he stored away the immortal Gu formation and the other Gu Immortals into his immortal aperture before setting off again.\n\nHe had to continue moving.\n\nNot only did Heavenly Court know his location and would send Gu Immortals at him, even heaven’s will was plotting.\n\nIf Fang Yuan and the rest stayed at a place for long, they would meet with many problems.\n\nIn white heaven.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle shook off its blood and flew up.\n\nBehind it, an Immortal Gu House carrying two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals chased relentlessly.\n\n“This upper extreme heavenly eagle is reaching its limit.”\n\n“That’s right, it was really good at enduring and flying.”\n\n“Alright, let’s end it, this move will let you rest!”\n\nThe Immortal Gu House rapidly grew in aura as a golden beam of light shot out.\n\nThe golden light was extremely fast, landing on the upper extreme heavenly eagle.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle suffered a huge blow, it quickly flapped its wings and tried to escape.\n\nBut the golden beam of light was long and thin, it was like a shadow, homing in on the upper extreme heavenly eagle.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle’s injuries got more severe, its body was covered in a layer of golden light, making its movement even slower.\n\nBut at the next moment, a change occurred.\n\nA white cloud formed in the path of the falling upper extreme heavenly eagle.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle fell into the cloud and vanished.\n\n“Oh no, this is a black-white overturning cloud!”\n\n“Quickly stop the killer move, don’t destroy this cloud!!”\n\nThe two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals shouted in shock, but it was too late, everything had happened too quickly.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle vanished in the cloud, while the golden beam of light landed on the white cloud, dying it golden.\n\nThe golden cloud became extremely heavy and fell downwards.\n\nAt this time, the golden beam of light vanished as the two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals stopped the killer move.\n\nBut now, their smug appearance was gone, replaced by a dumbfounded look.\n\n“How could this happen?!”\n\n“Wasn’t it too coincidental?”\n\n“The black-white overturning cloud can connect between black heaven and white heaven, anything that enters will be able to move between the two heavens.”\n\n“We were concerned about this, so we had already destroyed all of the clouds that could potentially be black-white overturning clouds already.”\n\n“To think that a new one would appear and the upper extreme heavenly eagle had to crash into it.”\n\n“This damned luck!!”\n\nThe two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were going frantic, they wanted to spit blood, after so much hard work, and expending a great deal of immortal essence, right before success, this happened!\n\n“Chase!”\n\n“The upper extreme heavenly eagle still has our investigative killer move. We will return through the heavenly wind qi wall and go back to black heaven.”\n\n“That’s right, this is our first mission after joining Heavenly Court, how can we fail? Even if we have to chase it to the ends of the world, we will capture this upper extreme heavenly eagle!”"
