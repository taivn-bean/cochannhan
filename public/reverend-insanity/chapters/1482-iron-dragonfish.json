For example, ghost official garment was greatly weakened due to ghostly concealment.\n\nOther than deducing Sixth Hair’s problem and the killer move to protect the time path clone from heaven’s will, Fang Yuan had to modify his luck path killer moves.\n\nWisdom path, sword path, and soul path killer moves had already been modified to his limit, now was luck path.\n\nFang Yuan had many useful luck path true inheritances, among these assorted inheritances, the most prominent ones were Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s self luck and all living beings luck true inheritances.\n\nFang Yuan had the complete content of the former and an incomplete version of the latter.\n\nHe had many luck path Immortal Gu, Dog Shit Luck, Qi Luck, Luck Inspection, Connect Luck, and Time Luck were all rank six, they were not very suitable to Fang Yuan now since he was already rank seven.\n\nFang Yuan was not going to rank up his luck path Immortal Gu for now, his focus was to refine one Gu, it was Spring Autumn Cicada!\n\nRank six Spring Autumn Cicada could only allow rank six Gu Immortals to rebirth, Fang Yuan had rank seven cultivation level now, he needed rank seven Spring Autumn Cicada. Either that or rank six Spring Autumn Cicada used as a core of a rank seven immortal killer move.\n\nHe was still at the initial stage of Spring Autumn Cicada’s refinement, Sixth Hair was in charge of the entire Immortal Gu recipe, he was collecting the necessary Gu materials.\n\nFang Yuan did not forget to practise his killer moves.\n\nHe had modified his soul path killer moves long ago, he was very skilled with them now. Fang Yuan would practice the sword path and wisdom path killer moves from time to time, revising their usage.\n\nFang Yuan knew that he had to work hard during peaceful times, by the time he fights, these killer moves would be instinctive to him. If his killer move fails during battle and he loses his momentum, that would be a disaster.\n\nAmong the killer moves he practised, wisdom path killer move exposing heavenly secret was the most important.\n\nThis killer move used heavenly secret Immortal Gu as the core to deduce the contents of the following tribulation. Of course, there was a limit to it, Fang Yuan could not deduce the content of his next grand tribulation yet, he needed to wait for some time.\n\nOther than exposing heavenly secret, Fang Yuan also needed to practise heaven’s will dissipation.\n\nThis killer move was Fang Yuan’s greatest success during this period of time, he was not going to give it up.\n\nExposing heavenly secret allowed Fang Yuan to learn about the thinking of heaven’s will. Heaven’s will dissipation was a countermeasure that needed to be modified further, because it took a long time to prepare, it could only be used in the background now, it could not be utilized in an actual battle.\n\nHis red date immortal essence was barely enough for use.\n\nHis immortal essence stone storage had run dry already.\n\nThe members of Shadow Sect were all developing well. Making use of Tai Qiu, they were accumulating resources, replenishing the amount they lost while escaping from Southern Border, they even improved in some aspects.\n\nFang Yuan only took away the souls of the desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts that they captured, the remaining corpses were immortal materials that could be sold for a high price.\n\nFang Yuan did not go after their gains, on one hand he was not attracted to this small amount, on another hand he wanted to maintain the rules of Shadow Sect. At the crucial moment, Fang Yuan could borrow resources from them for emergencies, Fang Yuan was not shy to do that.\n\nBut if he tried that now, he would ruin their momentum and growth, the cost was too high compared to the benefits in this situation.\n\nEven though he obtained Shadow Sect’s inheritance and gained a deeper understanding of Heavenly Court, there were many things that Fang Yuan did not know. Against such a huge organization, the tactic of Shadow Sect that they used in the five hundred years of his previous life were worth mimicking.\n\nThus, other than his own cultivation, Fang Yuan started plotting.\n\nHe had some relationship with the five regions in some way or another now, even though he was wanted by the righteous path forces of Northern Plains including Longevity Heaven, he had become part of the variant human alliance due to the engagement, his relationship with the variant humans was very close now.\n\nThe problem now was that Fang Yuan lacked funds.\n\nConsecutive Gu refinement, cultivation, and practise of killer moves made his funds run dry. Even though he scrimped and saved, and his red date immortal essence also replenish on its own, Fang Yuan’s advancement was too fast, he was operating at a deficit now, his funds could not catch up to his expenditure.\n\nFor this problem, Fang Yuan’s solution was the dragonfish business.\n\nBut not long ago, You Chan also started to sell copper dragonfish, Fang Yuan was slightly surprised.\n\nBut Fang Yuan soon accepted the fact.\n\nDragonfish was different from guts Gu, new products could be deduced and created by his competitors too.\n\nThis was like how Fang Yuan modified the light shine fungi.\n\nHe could modify people’s products, they could do the same to him.\n\nIt was not like the guts Gu business, other than him, nobody else could produce it, that was truly the monopoly that Gu Immortals dreamed of.\n\nThus, it was not strange that others could sell copper dragonfish. Fang Yuan was only surprised that You Chan did it so quickly.\n\nDays passed by.\n\nImmortal killer move — Years Pass Like Days!\n\nThe tributary of the River of Time in sovereign immortal aperture expanded rapidly, the river water started to flow faster.\n\nThe sovereign immortal aperture originally had very high rate of time to begin with, after using this killer move, the time flow became even faster.\n\nThis way, calamities and tribulations would occur more rapidly.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had no fear.\n\nHe was already unmoved by calamities and tribulations at this point. As for grand tribulations, he had heavenly secret Gu and exposing heavenly secret, what was there to fear?\n\nThe increase in his rate of time also led to the increased production of other resources.\n\nEspecially dragonfish.\n\nIn dragon scale sea area, a large number of dragonfish were swimming around. Most were ordinary red dragonfish, thirty percent were copper dragonfish, and the rest were black in color.\n\n“This is my iron dragonfish.” Fang Yuan smiled.\n\nWith this huge formation, his dragonfish did not need to be researched on, the modification was automated.\n\n“This time, after I sell the iron dragonfish, I wonder how You Chan will react?”"
