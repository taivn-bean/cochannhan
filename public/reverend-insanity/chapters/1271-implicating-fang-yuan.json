This blessed land was the foundation of the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation, as long as they defended it, Central Continent would lose.\n\n“What should we do?” Bi Chen Tian had a frantic expression: “If this continues, not only will we fail to save Ma Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun, we will also lose this Immortal Gu House and our own lives!”\n\nWei Ling Yang was the leader of this expedition, he had a grim expression.\n\nThe situation was very disadvantageous for the Central Continent Gu Immortals.\n\nIt could even be said they were hopeless.\n\nAccording to the plans of Central Continent’s Gu Immortals, they were split into two, one group would restrain Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace, while the other would save Ma Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun, before they joined up and left Northern Plains together.\n\nBut now, the group that went to Snowy Mountain blessed land was already close to defeat, and the other group was also waiting for their rescue.\n\nThis was Northern Plains, not Central Continent.\n\nThree rank eights and three Immortal Gu Houses, along with a band of Gu Immortals, were still a relatively small number of people.\n\nOf course, this was also because the Northern Plains Gu Immortals were prepared. Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s plan was not known to Central Continent.\n\nCentral Continent struck with a powerful attack, according to the planning of this assault, there was a huge chance of success.\n\nBut as the situation progressed, the targets of their sneak attack became strong foes, and with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s arrangements, Central Continent’s Gu Immortals fell into this dangerous situation.\n\nWei Ling Yang’s thoughts were churning rapidly.\n\nA moment later, he gritted his teeth and gave his orders, seemingly exerting his last bit of strength: “We will retreat!”\n\nForget about Zhao Lian Yun and Ma Hong Yun.\n\nAfter Purple Mountain True Monarch appeared, the situation went beyond Wei Ling Yang’s control.\n\nIf this dragged on, Central Continent would suffer even greater losses!\n\nWei Ling Yang decided to retreat back to black heaven, and join up with the other two Immortal Gu Houses and escape to Central Continent.\n\nEdge Link Camp was directed to leave, Old Ancestor Xue Hu and Purple Mountain True Monarch could not stop it together. After all, they had no Immortal Gu Houses, they could not stop it from charging away.\n\nHowever!\n\nJust when Edge Link Camp was about to charge out of the Gu formation, a change occurred.\n\nThe entirety of Snowy Mountain blessed land was rumbling intensely.\n\nA great earthquake!\n\n“What is going on?”\n\n“The blessed land is collapsing!”\n\nZhao Lian Yun and the others, as well as the remaining peak lords, were extremely shocked.\n\nRumble!\n\nWith a loud sound, the snowy peaks started to break apart.\n\n“What is going on?!” Old Ancestor Xue Hu showed shock on his face.\n\n“The entire formation is breaking apart.” Purple Mountain True Monarch’s eyes shined brightly, before he corrected himself: “No! This formation…”\n\nBefore he finished his words, the Gu Immortals present heard the sound of waves.\n\nAt the next moment, giant rushing waves appeared out of nowhere, sweeping the battlefield!\n\nIt was the secluded domain of heaven and earth — Reverse Flow River!!\n\n“Oh no, my wife!” Everything happened too quickly, Old Ancestor Xue Hu wanted to charge back to the first peak, but he was engulfed by the river along the way.\n\nWithin Reverse Flow River, no Gu worms could be activated.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu could not defend himself, he was washed away by the rushing tides.\n\nHe had the highest battle strength in this place, if this happened to him, there was no need to mention the rest.\n\nImmortal Gu House Edge Link Camp broke apart in the river, the Central Continent Gu Immortals were washed along the river like falling dumplings.\n\nZhao Lian Yun and the rest, the peak lords of Snowy Mountain blessed land, Lady Wan Shou, Ying Wu Xie’s group, and Ma Hong Yun, were all inside Reverse Flow River.\n\nSnowy Mountain blessed land completely collapsed, only a framework was left as the winds of assimilation started to blow.\n\n“They’re coming!” Far away, Black Extremity’s head was bulging with veins, he manipulated the sub formation with all his strength.\n\nHe was the culprit behind Snowy Mountain’s destruction.\n\nAnd beside him, Flood Extremity was defending him vigilantly, at the final moment, Flood Extremity had to use his water path methods to direct Reverse Flow River.\n\n“What?!” Fang Yuan felt his vision turning bright as a huge torrent engulfed him in an instant.\n\nOnce the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation broke, everyone and everything within the surrounding ten thousand li of Snowy Mountain blessed land was engulfed by Reverse Flow River.\n\nFang Yuan was within this range, he was not spared.\n\nFrom the raging river water, Fang Yuan’s head emerged on the surface.\n\n“This is — Reverse Flow River?!” He had a wide range of knowledge, after his shock, he realized the origin of the river that he was in.\n\n“Snowy Mountain blessed land contains Reverse Flow River?”\n\n“No wonder my ancient sword dragon transformation was removed for no apparent reason.”\n\nThis was natural.\n\nInside Reverse Flow River, Gu worms could not be used. Fang Yuan’s ancient sword dragon transformation was an immortal killer move, it needed Immortal Gu and mortal Gu to activate.\n\nThus, the moment Fang Yuan was swept in, all of his Gu worms stopped working, he returned to his original form.\n\n“Thankfully, I can swim.” Fang Yuan moved his limbs, swimming skillfully.\n\nHe looked ahead, on the surface of the raging river, there were many things floating or swimming. Large numbers of wild beasts, trees and grass, and even rocks.\n\nReverse Flow River’s waves were extremely rough, gushes of currents caused rocks or trees to move around randomly, creating chaos in the river.\n\nFang Yuan’s heart sank, in this situation, he could not use Gu worms, his battle strength was at rock bottom, he could only rely on his own body’s defense.\n\nAt this time, Fang Yuan heard something that did not sound right near him.\n\nHe quickly turned around, he saw that a giant metal tree was flowing along the river, the trunk was as thick as an elephant, it rushed towards him.\n\n“Danger!” Fang Yuan’s pupils shrunk, he wanted to dodge.\n\nBut in the torrential Reverse Flow River, he could not move easily, his speed was very slow, the metal tree crashed into his waist.\n\nFang Yuan was quickly knocked into the depths of the river.\n\nNext, he rapidly moved his four limbs, before resurfacing above the river.\n\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh!\n\nHe breathed raggedly, taking in fresh air as he inspected his body, checking his injuries.\n\nHe was shocked when he checked it.\n\nBecause he had no injuries.\n\nHe only had a bruise on his waist.\n\nBut soon, his bruise vanished.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined, he realized: “Oh right! My body is not normal, I have the sovereign immortal body!”\n\nInside Reverse Flow River, Fang Yuan could not use any Gu worms, he could only rely on his own body.\n\nHowever!\n\nHis sovereign immortal body was not normal at all."
