  "content": "Chapter 1401: Enslavement After Victorious Fight\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nLarge numbers of year beasts, chicken, sheep, monkey, dog, pig, horse, tiger, rabbit, they bore their fangs and claws as they attacked Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was soon encircled.\n\nBut he was daring and courageous, his expression did not change, he was still calm and composed.\n\n“Come at me!” He shouted, his body shook as he used an immortal killer move.\n\nDing ding ding…\n\nThere was a clear crisp sound in the battlefield.\n\nIt was like countless jade pearls landing on a jade plate.\n\nImmortal killer move — Green Jade Song!\n\nThe year beasts closer to him suffered injuries, they were corroded by the song as they quickly turned into green jade stones.\n\nThe year beasts’ ferocious attacks were immediately resisted.\n\nBut soon, from the year beast group, eight ancient year beasts emerged.\n\nDragon, snake, tiger, ox, they attacked Feng Jiu Ge from four directions.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge snorted, the sound waves around him grew more intense, around him, a green jade sound wave pushed towards his surroundings.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nThe eight ancient year beasts were pushed back to their original places by these intense sound waves.\n\nBefore they landed, they were turned into jade statues as they shattered, dying as they broke into small jade pieces.\n\n“Green jade song is so powerful!” The Shadow Sect immortals lying in ambush saw this and expressed their shock.\n\nOnly Fang Yuan’s expression did not change.\n\nHe knew some intel.\n\nHe knew about the battle between Qin Bai Sheng and Feng Jiu Ge thanks to Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance.\n\n“Feng Jiu Ge’s green jade song has gotten much stronger since the battle of Luo Po Valley. It seems he has improved it a lot.”\n\n“Green jade song is secondary, but if he uses submission song, half of the year beasts here would likely turn into my enemy.”\n\n“However, even if that happens, hehe!”\n\nFang Yuan laughed internally.\n\nThere was a lump of water in his right palm.\n\nThis ball of water was emitting a weak eerie ripple, looking at it, it seemed to be the water of the River of Time.\n\nBut in truth, it was a rank eight Immortal Gu —\n\nYears Flow Like Water!\n\nIndeed, this Immortal Gu obtained from Hei Fan’s true inheritance had always been sealed.\n\nBut now, Fang Yuan had unsealed and used it.\n\nImmortal killer move — Year Beast Summoning.\n\nIt was the same name, but the current year beast summoning was completely different from before. This was because the core was no longer year Gu, but the rank eight Immortal Gu Years Flow Like Water!\n\nHei Fan’s true inheritance was very detailed about this. There were two versions, year beast summoning using year Gu as the core, as well as using years flow like water Immortal Gu as the core.\n\nThe ordinary year beast summoning could only summon one year beast. But the one that Fang Yuan was using now could summon an army of year beasts!\n\nImmortal killer move — Submission Song!\n\nIndeed, as the battle continued, Feng Jiu Ge used this incredible killer move.\n\nThe entire place was silent.\n\nThe song could not be heard with the ears, it was heard in every Gu Immortal’s and year beast’s mind directly.\n\nThe year beast army went into chaos.\n\nBecause many year beasts submitted to Feng Jiu Ge and fought against their former allies.\n\nSubmission song encompassed wisdom path, enslavement path, sound path, and soul path, it affected the mind. The inspiration was obtained during the battle with Qin Bai Sheng when he used five finger fist heart sword.\n\nMany desolate level year beasts and ancient year beasts switched sides and obeyed Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nThe battle changed intensely.\n\nFairy Miao Yin and Lady White Rabbit, who were watching the battle, gasped in shock.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was still calm.\n\nHe continued to use immortal killer move year beast summoning.\n\nRank eight Immortal Gu Years Flow Like Water could be used by even rank six Gu Immortals. And Fang Yuan was already experienced with using this immortal killer move, year beast summoning, he had practised it so that he could use it in battle one day!\n\nIf one did not have huge worries, they would worry about smaller things.\n\nFang Yuan was a vigilant person, he had preparations in advance, at this moment, he benefited greatly from it, thus he had no problems.\n\n“Year beast summoning will continue to summon year beasts, I want to see how many your submission song can control.”\n\n“At a certain stage, even immemorial year beasts will respond and come here.”\n\nYear beast summoning was a time path method that had the effect of enslavement path.\n\nAnd enslavement path excelled in battles of attrition.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was a strong enemy, Fang Yuan was not counting on being able to kill him currently. Moreover, Feng Jiu Ge was backed by Heavenly Court, there might be other rank eight Gu Immortals hiding somewhere.\n\nBecause of these two reasons, Fang Yuan decided to hide himself and use the year beasts to attack and expend his energy.\n\nAn endless stream of year beasts continued to rush out of the tributary of the River of Time, responding to Fang Yuan’s call and attacking Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nSoon, the number of year beasts on this battlefield reached a hundred and more.\n\nA large number of year beasts made a circle and surrounded Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge relied on submission song to control the year beasts and avert the crisis, creating his own defensive circle within the encirclement.\n\nThe battle was in a deadlock.\n\nThis scene was clearly observed by Fairy Zi Wei.\n\nShe was in Central Continent’s Heavenly Court, but using the investigative killer move, and Star Constellation Chessboard, she could observe the entire battlefield clearly.\n\nFairy Zi Wei’s eyes were flickering with thoughts.\n\nKilling Fang Yuan, and taking or destroying Red Lotus’ true inheritance was her main objective now.\n\nShe had already made all the plans, Feng Jiu Ge was just a part of them.\n\nEven though the battle was in a deadlock, Fairy Zi Wei was aware that Feng Jiu Ge was not using his full strength. Even if he was, he still had the rank eight Immortal Gu that Heavenly Court had lent him!\n\n“Right now, everything is under my control.” Fairy Zi Wei willed as the image on Star Constellation Chessboard changed to another battle.\n\nTwo Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were fighting against an upper extreme heavenly eagle.\n\nThis upper extreme heavenly eagle was the one which had escaped from Fang Yuan’s control and flew away.\n\nThe upper extreme heavenly eagle cried out, it had injuries on it.\n\nIt did not have any Immortal Gu, even though it was an immemorial desolate beast, it was too hard to fight against two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals.\n\nThe battle was not in its favor.\n\n“This upper extreme heavenly eagle has Fang Yuan’s tracking method on it. As long as we capture it, I will be able to reverse-deduce his location.”\n\n“Of course, right now, Fang Yuan and the others have been hit by my investigative killer move. Capturing the upper extreme heavenly eagle is to prevent Fang Yuan from regaining control of this immemorial desolate beast in the future.”\n\nFairy Zi Wei planned.\n\nFang Yuan was a complete otherworldly demon, he was no longer under fate’s control, he was the biggest uncertainty in this world.\n\nRight now, he had Giant Sun’s true inheritance, the combination of otherworldly demon and luck path meant that these uncertainties were stacking up, leading to greater unknowns.\n\nSpectral Soul was captured already, Fang Yuan was now Heavenly Court’s biggest threat.\n\nBut Heavenly Court could not use its full strength against Fang Yuan.\n\nFirstly, Fang Yuan had extremely strong luck, if too many people went after him, he would benefit from the misfortune instead. Only someone of similarly high luck could stop Fang Yuan’s luck path advantage from showing.\n\nThis was the reason why Fairy Zi Wei arranged for Feng Jiu Ge to deal with Fang Yuan.\n\nSecondly, Heavenly Court also needed to develop.\n\nThe great era was coming, the five regional walls would dissipate and the five regions would become one. Without any geographical obstacles, Gu Immortals could travel freely, there was sure to be chaos.\n\nDuring such unprecedented chaotic battles, Heavenly Court would be in an awkward spot.\n\nBecause it was encircled by Southern Border, Northern Plains, Eastern Sea, and Western Desert, Central Continent was right in the middle, bordering all four regions.\n\nOnce battle erupted, Central Continent would face great pressure, it might get into great trouble.\n\nThus, Heavenly Court needed to prepare itself.\n\nAt the same time, Star Constellation heaven’s will also instructed Duke Long and Fairy Zi Wei that she needed many rank eight Gu Immortals to hibernate in the future.\n\nEven though Fairy Zi Wei did not understand why this was needed, she trusted Star Constellation heaven’s will and Duke Long.\n\n“Lady Zi Wei, there is great news!” At this time, a Heavenly Court Gu Immortal sent a letter Gu to Fairy Zi Wei.\n\nFairy Zi Wei knew that this person was recently recruited, originally being a supreme elder in one of the ten great ancient sects, Yuan Qiong Du.\n\nEver since the battle of the dream realm, Fairy Zi Wei had elevated multiple Gu Immortals from the ten great ancient sects to become members of Heavenly Court.\n\nThe two Heavenly Court Gu Immortals who informed Feng Jiu Ge and were now chasing the upper extreme heavenly eagle were also such people.\n\nAs for this Yuan Qiong Du, because he cultivated refinement path, Fairy Zi Wei tasked him with the mission of repairing fate Gu.\n\n“What good news?” Fairy Zi Wei asked.\n\n“I have bought a batch of year beasts in treasure yellow heaven. The seller might not know, but these year beasts are different from normal year beasts, they are filled with heaven’s will. I can use these year beasts as immortal materials to repair fate Immortal Gu. Not only can we save time, we can use the heaven’s will inside to increase the effects.” Yuan Qiong Du was extremely excited.\n\n“Very good.” Fairy Zi Wei’s eyes were shining: “Continue working hard.”\n\n“Yes, Lady Zi Wei.”\n\nThis was indeed great news.\n\nFairy Zi Wei was quite happy.\n\n“This way, fate Gu can be repaired even more quickly, until its wounds are healed.”\n\n“With Spectral Soul captured now, once news gets out, it will shake the world and deter all the forces.”\n\nThinking of this, Fairy Zi Wei felt deep admiration towards Duke Long.\n\nDuke Long’s wise and resolute attack created Heavenly Court’s current huge advantage.\n\nIf the five regions chaotic war started, Central Continent could definitely benefit the most in the initial period.\n\nHowever, the true deciding factor of this chaotic war was one person.\n\nGreat Dream Immortal Venerable!\n\nWestern Desert.\n\nFang Yuan was at a crucial moment.\n\nFight Immortal Gu was activated, around it were a large number of supplementary Gu worms.\n\nImmortal killer move — Enslavement After Victorious Fight!\n\nThe killer move activation succeeded, Fang Yuan’s gaze turned sharp, he looked towards the year beast army.\n\nCountless strength path giant hands flew out and defeated these year beasts.\n\nThe defeated year beasts no longer ran away, due to the effect of enslavement after victorious fight, they became Fang Yuan’s slaves, gathering towards him."
