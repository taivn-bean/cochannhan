Back then, when he and Tang clan interacted and worked together, he was not just trying to use their tributary of the River of Time, he also wanted to work with them sincerely.\n\nHeavenly Court was now aggressively plotting for the future, when the great era arrives.\n\nYou Chan and Qin Bai He were almost used by Fairy Zi Wei as pawns, therefore Fang Yuan had to eliminate them.\n\nBe it for the dragonfish business’ profits, or the situation of the future.\n\nTo contest with a powerhouse like Heavenly Court, Fang Yuan’s schemes needed to be elevated to encompass all five regions, he needed to plot against the world!\n\nTang Fang Ming was extremely happy that Fang Yuan had arrived.\n\nThe last time Fang Yuan left Western Desert, he was escaping, Tang Fang Ming did not expect him to return so quickly.\n\n“Bring me to Thieving Heaven’s dream realm.” Fang Yuan spoke directly regarding his goal.\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan acts quickly, I am in deep admiration, please follow me.” Tang Fang Ming led the way.\n\nThe two flew for a while before arriving on top of an unassuming desert.\n\nTang Fang Ming stopped and stretched out his finger as a crack opened in the air, immortal aura permeated from it.\n\nFang Yuan was a formation path grandmaster, he had deep foundations, after seeing this immortal formation, his eyes shined as he praised: “What a good immortal Gu formation!”\n\nThis immortal formation’s concealment was incredible, even if Fang Yuan had his investigative killer move active, he could not detect it.\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan, follow me.” Tang Fang Ming entered the crack first.\n\nFang Yuan did not hesitate, he followed.\n\nAfter entering it, Fang Yuan found out that the space created by this immortal formation was like a grassland.\n\nHis field of vision was very wide, there was lush greenery all around, and the most attracting thing was Thieving Heaven’s dream realm at the center of the plain!\n\nThieving Heaven’s dream realm was huge, like a mountain.\n\nIt was emitting a blue eerie light, radiating the entire formation path space.\n\nThe five regions chaotic war had not started yet, but this dream realm of Thieving Heaven was uncovered earlier and found by Tang clan, they secretly kept it and had been researching it.\n\nEven though Tang clan obtained this precious treasure, they were clueless about dream path, their progress was very slow in it.\n\nAnd this progress was already built on Tang Fang Ming’s great talent and ingenuity.\n\nEven so, he nearly died in the dream realm, if his sister had not given up the clues to Paradise Earth’s true inheritance and got help from White Sea Shatuo, Tang Fang Ming would have died.\n\nAnd White Sea Shatuo was a split soul of Spectral Soul, during the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain, he led the Western Desert Shadow Sect members and died in the battlefield.\n\nFang Yuan did not mention the incident with White Sea Shatuo to Tang clan or Tang Fang Ming, the clue of Paradise Earth’s true inheritance was also in Fang Yuan’s hands currently.\n\nParadise Earth’s true inheritance was not Fang Yuan’s focus now, he was looking at the huge dream realm of Thieving Heaven now.\n\nThis blue and dazzling dream realm was very dangerous!\n\nBecause it contained heaven’s will.\n\nHeaven’s will could invade dream realms, Fang Yuan had suffered from this during the Southern Border dream realm incident.\n\nLong ago, when he explored the dream realm of Starry Sky grotto-heaven, he also met with heaven’s will. Heaven’s will appeared in Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s form to advise him, and allowed him to outwit Spectral Soul during the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain.\n\nAs the saying goes, people learn from mistakes, an old demon like Fang Yuan drilled this lesson into the depths of his heart.\n\n“Once the dream realm manifests for too long, heaven’s will would invade it, that happened in Southern Border’s giant dream realm, Thieving Heaven’s dream realm, in Western Desert, has been around for even longer, I’m sure heaven’s will has already completely taken over.” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone with an eerie light.\n\n“If it were before, I would need to avoid it. But now… hehe.” Fang Yuan’s lips curled up as he stretched out his arm, aiming at Thieving Heaven’s dream realm.\n\nImmortal aura surged as Fang Yuan’s body was covered in a grey-white light.\n\nHis palms were also enveloped by this grey-white light.\n\nFang Yuan took a step forward and let both palms approach the dream realm, eventually, the grey-white light came into contact with Thieving Heaven’s dream realm while Fang Yuan’s palms were merely an inch away.\n\nFang Yuan had the sovereign immortal body, not Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique. If he really touched it, his soul would be trapped inside the dream realm. He was very vigilant about that.\n\nThe grey-white light flowed like water, entering Thieving Heaven’s dream realm without obstruction.\n\nThe grey-white light continued to permeate as it spread out towards the surroundings from Fang Yuan’s palms as the center.\n\nThis phenomenon lasted for a while, it was as if the mountain-like dream realm was covered by a grey-white light.\n\nThe light continued to expand, but Tang Fang Ming only watched quietly by the side.\n\nHe could not tell what it was, but he knew it was an immortal killer move.\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan is truly formidable, he actually created an immortal killer move against the dream realm! Compared to him, I have only created several dream path mortal Gu. There truly is a mountain above a mountain, a man standing above another man!” Tang Fang Ming felt deep admiration, he felt how unfathomable Fang Yuan was.\n\nFang Yuan was expressionless, but he was quite nervous internally.\n\nHe was activating the immortal killer move, heaven’s will dissipation! Even though it was not his first time, this was his first attempt at using it on a dream realm.\n\nHeaven’s will dissipation used heavenly secret Immortal Gu as the core, it could eliminate heaven’s will. He had used it against Spring Autumn Cicada earlier, now that he was using it on a dream realm, who knew what would happen.\n\nTime passed, ten minutes went by quickly.\n\nThe grey-white light had expanded quite a lot, not only on the surface, but also into Thieving Heaven’s dream realm.\n\nThieving Heaven’s dream realm was like a mountain, but one-tenth of it was already covered by grey-white light.\n\nJust when Tang Fang Ming thought that the grey-white light was going to expand further, it stopped moving as multicolored eyes started to appear from the grey-white light.\n\nThese eyes were very special, they changed colors with each blink.\n\nThe number of multicolored eyes increased rapidly, after a few breaths of time, they went from tens to hundreds, and to thousands in a flash.\n\nAfter several tens of breaths, there were millions of multicolored eyes, they filled the grey-white light, not only on the surface, but also inside the light itself.\n\n“There is an effect!” Fang Yuan was excited internally but remained expressionless, Tang Fang Ming could not sense the fluctuation of his emotions.\n\nThe multicolored eyes continued to blink as Fang Yuan’s red date immortal essence was expended rapidly. The heaven’s will in Thieving Heaven’s dream realm was also getting wiped out along with it.\n\nThe multicolored eyes blinked for several times before vanishing, but new eyes would grow in their place.\n\nHeaven’s will was rapidly destroyed, after a while, there was no heaven’s will left in the grey-white light.\n\nAt this time, the grey-white light would expand as the multicolored eyes moved in for more destruction.\n\nFang Yuan activated heaven’s will dissipation for three days and nights.\n\nEventually, in Thieving Heaven’s dream realm, there was none of heaven’s will remaining.\n\nFang Yuan continued to activate the killer move and kept a veil of grey-white light around Thieving Heaven’s dream realm at all times. This way, as long as heaven’s will tried to invade it, it would be destroyed by the multicolored eyes in the white light.\n\nAnd now, Thieving Heaven’s dream realm was finally safe!\n\n“Next, I will explore this dream realm.” Fang Yuan let out a breath of air, he was filled with joy in his heart."
