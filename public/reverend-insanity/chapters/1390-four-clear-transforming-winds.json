At this moment, as it grabbed down, it looked like it had the power to slaughter immortals!\n\nThe finger wind dragon gave a miserable cry and struggled fiercely. Several breaths later, it completely broke apart, turning into gusts of wind which soon dissipated.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s expression turned solemn.\n\nFinger wind dragon was undoubtedly a rank eight killer move, but Wu Yong’s yin wind ghost sickle hand clearly appeared to be much more powerful!\n\nIf this hand had grabbed Feng Jiu Ge, the consequences were too miserable to imagine.\n\nIf Fang Yuan had not interfered at the crucial moment, Feng Jiu Ge would still be being chased by the finger wind dragon and would also have to face yin wind ghost sickle hand, his situation would have been extremely precarious!\n\nWu Yong’s expression was similarly unsightly.\n\nHe had been preparing yin wind ghost sickle hand for a long while, and had thought of defeating Feng Jiu Ge with this.\n\nBut with Fang Yuan’s interference, he had no choice but to change the target to finger wind dragon, wasting this great killer move.\n\nIn fact, yin wind ghost sickle hand had a subsequent transformation as well, it was called yin wind rope and its ability was to capture Gu Immortals.\n\nAfter all, Feng Jiu Ge was from Central Continent, Wu Yong had spent such a large amount of effort and immortal essence to prepare yin wind ghost sickle hand so as to capture Feng Jiu Ge alive.\n\nIf he achieved his goal, he would have gained huge benefits.\n\nFirstly, if Wu Yong captured a person like Feng Jiu Ge alive, it would be a huge boost to his own fame and would have a huge influence on Southern Border’s righteous path as well.\n\nSecondly, just capturing Feng Jiu Ge and not killing him would mean they would not have to fall out with Central Continent and Heavenly Court.\n\nFinally, after capturing Feng Jiu Ge, Wu Yong could not only extort him, he could also blackmail Spirit Affinity House and even Heavenly Court.\n\nIf he could make Heavenly Court compromise and hand over those Immortal Gu they took from the super Gu formation, even if it was just a portion of them, Wu Yong’s prestige in the whole of Southern Border’s Gu Immortal world would definitely rise to unprecedented heights!\n\nIt could even directly stabilize Wu clan as the number one force of the righteous path in Southern Border’s Gu Immortal world!\n\nBut now, Fang Yuan had disrupted his plan.\n\n“These two guys…”\n\n“If I use ordinary rank seven killer moves, Feng Jiu Ge could easily resist them and even counterattack.”\n\n“If I use rank eight killer moves, although I would be able to force back Feng Jiu Ge and suppress him, I would have to go through Fang Yuan’s reverse flow protection seal. If the killer move is reflected, I would be the one to suffer losses.”\n\nWu Yong’s eyelids twitched slightly at his present situation.\n\nIt was problematic.\n\nHe felt a little troubled.\n\nIf he was just facing Fang Yuan, Wu Yong could completely treat him like a sandbag and have full initiative. If he was facing just Feng Jiu Ge, he could also forcefully suppress the latter.\n\nBut if he was to face both of them…\n\nWu Yong was troubled.\n\n“There is not much hope in breaking reverse flow protection seal in a short period of time. This is the first time I am witnessing this move and I am also not a wisdom path Gu Immortal.”\n\n“Maybe Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven have already researched and made countermeasures against reverse flow protection seal.”\n\n“But the only way now is to continue attacking them until they are unable to cope with the attacks, then find an opportunity to kill them.”\n\nIf there was no opportunity in battle, he would create it himself.\n\nThinking of this, Wu Yong suddenly concealed himself, disappearing from Fang Yuan’s and Feng Jiu Ge’s sights.\n\n“He disappeared, where is he?” Fang Yuan looked at Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nWu Yong was taking a step back for the sake of advancing further, Fang Yuan’s investigative methods were no good and was simply unable to sense Wu Yong’s location.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge also shook his head: “He seems to be using this battlefield to hide himself.”\n\nHe could only detect some vague details.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had just finished speaking, when there was a sudden change in the whole battlefield!\n\nWhoosh whoosh whoosh…\n\nFierce wind rose from nowhere, making whizzing noises as it moved around the battlefield like formless pythons.\n\nThen, wind blades formed out of the wind.\n\nEach wind blade carried the piercing power of a rank eight killer move, they maneuvered around in the air and charged towards Fang Yuan and Feng Jiu Ge.\n\n“Good.” Fang Yuan was happy instead of startled, his robe fluttered behind as he charged ahead.\n\nThe wind blades, however, nimbly passed around him and shot towards Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nWu Yong wanted to get rid of Feng Jiu Ge first before he dealt with Fang Yuan.\n\nThis choice was extremely wise.\n\nBecause only Feng Jiu Ge had the ability to counterattack. Once he was dead or captured, what could Fang Yuan do with just reverse flow protection seal?\n\nFeng Jiu Ge smiled brightly at this: “Interesting, I am being treated as a pushover.”\n\nHis tone was not furious, instead it had some joy and curiosity.\n\nHe had never experienced such a feeling.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge sent out punches and palm strikes, destroying the wind blades.\n\nBut after being destroyed, the wind blades turned into gusts of fierce wind which whizzed around before condensing into new wind blades.\n\nThe wind blades shot forward continuously and with an increasing amount.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge did not dare to let these wind blades touch him, but despite destroying them as early as possible, he was now in a passive situation.\n\nFang Yuan quickly rushed forward to help.\n\nThis time, Fang Yuan lingered beside Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nMany wind blades struck Fang Yuan, but were immediately reflected back.\n\nHowever, they did not shoot back at Wu Yong, instead striking back at this battlefield.\n\nAlthough Wu Yong was the controller, he had manipulated the immortal battlefield killer move to send out the attacks. Hence, he was not the direct attacker.\n\nWu Yong became the mastermind manipulator, while Fang Yuan’s reverse flow protection seal could only reflect the attack to the attacker, as such, the wind blades could only target this battlefield.\n\nWu Yong, who was hiding in a corner, was inwardly joyous when he saw this, and put in even more strength into the battlefield killer move.\n\nFang Yuan was passively defending, his frown getting deeper as time passed.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s situation had already turned for the better with Fang Yuan’s protection. He thought for a moment before transmitting his voice to Fang Yuan: “Protect me while I prepare a move to destroy this battlefield.”\n\nFang Yuan was stunned, before quickly agreeing.\n\nPreviously, he had already deduced it would be difficult to break this battlefield killer move. It was very difficult to see any effects based on his strength and attainment. On the other hand, it was better to wait for air lock to dissipate and use Omni-directional Travel with Bai Ning Bing and the rest to leave this battlefield.\n\nSo he needed to stall for time to the greatest extent possible.\n\nIf he let Feng Jiu Ge fight with Wu Yong alone, Wu Yong would soon gain the upper hand and suppress Feng Jiu Ge, even getting rid of him, and then be free to deal with Fang Yuan.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge might have rank eight battle strength, but he was still rank seven after all.\n\nHence, Fang Yuan came to help.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge began to prepare his killer move, he did not resist, leaving his defense to Fang Yuan.\n\nSuch trust made Fang Yuan feel a little uncertain.\n\nSeeing this, Wu Yong hastened the battlefield killer move even more.\n\nThe wind blades were unable to do anything to Fang and Feng. Another change occurred in the battlefield, crackling of thunder could be heard.\n\nThis thunder was extremely peculiar.\n\nNormal thunder sounded like an explosion or rumbling.\n\nThis thunder, however, sounded bright and sharp, like knocking a gourd on a large hundred year old bamboo flute.\n\nSeveral breaths later, lightning bolts flickered as they struck down at Fang and Feng.\n\n“Careful, this is clear jade lightning.” Feng Jiu Ge warned.\n\nClear jade lightning emitted dazzling blue light, it was extremely fast and emitted such glaring light that Fang Yuan had to close his eyes.\n\nHe quickly activated his transformation method to change his eyes to dragon eyes, only then was he able to resist the dazzling lightning.\n\nFang Yuan was actively maintaining reverse flow protection seal, which took almost all of his attention, so he was not able to use ancient sword dragon transformation. But if it was just transforming his eyes, he could still do it.\n\nClear jade lightning struck down, Fang Yuan took it head-on. The jade lightning hit his body and was reflected back, wreaking havoc to the battlefield.\n\nBut some of the jade lightning struck towards Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nHowever, these clear jade lightning bolts disappeared without a trace when they had just neared Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was preparing a killer move, he naturally would not fully rely on Fang Yuan and had laid down some defensive methods.\n\nFang Yuan felt relieved at this, he could defend much more calmly now and even counterattack.\n\nWu Yong saw the lightning did not work and changed the battlefield again, lightning disappeared, strong wind weakened and changed into drops of beautiful green water pearls which then formed a thin drizzle.\n\n“Be careful, this is clear jade dripping wind.” Feng Jiu Ge warned once again.\n\nThis water pearl-like wind sprinkled on Fang Yuan’s body but were similarly reflected back, Fang Yuan was completely safe.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge, however, did not fare well.\n\nAs clear jade dripping wind neared him, they continued to disappear, but many water drops still landed on his body.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had defenses all over his body as well.\n\nThe clear jade water drops splashed on him, producing clear sounds.\n\nThe water continued to land on him, Feng Jiu Ge’s body seemed to have turned into a human shaped musical instrument, as delightful melodies echoed continuously.\n\nWu Yong laughed loudly and even revealed himself because he saw victory within his grasp: “My move still has another variation, its name is profound immortal sound. Feng Jiu Ge, you cultivate sound path, why don’t you evaluate this move.”\n\nAs his voice stopped, low murmurs of wind started to resound in the battlefield.\n\nThe sound of the wind was mild and clear, resounding within Fang Yuan’s mind. In an instant, the robe on Fang Yuan started shaking and billowing.\n\n“Not good, this profound immortal sound has the strongest offensive power among the four variation moves. Although I have reverse flow protection seal, I can only protect myself, how can I help Feng Jiu Ge?” Fang Yuan’s heart sank.\n\nWu Yong’s battlefield killer move was four clear transforming winds, it was created by a rank eight Wu clan ancestor and was passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThis four clear transforming winds had four variations, clear wind blades, clear jade lightning, clear jade dripping wind and profound immortal sound.\n\nIt was Wu clan’s trump card killer move with awe-inspiring might, and had helped Wu clan to dominate Southern Border for countless years."
