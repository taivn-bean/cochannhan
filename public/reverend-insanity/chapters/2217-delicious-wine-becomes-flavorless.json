  "content": "**Chapter 2217: Delicious Wine Becomes Flavorless**\n\nThe great Shen clan first supreme elder was crying with a tearful expression now.\n\nPart of it was definitely Shen Cong Sheng’s inner fear towards Fang Yuan, but he had deeper goals as well.\n\nWith the combined announcement of Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven, such news could not be fake.\n\nFang Yuan became Heaven Refining Demon Venerable, while news like Qi Sea Ancestor being Fang Yuan’s clone became known throughout the world.\n\nBefore this, Eastern Sea’s righteous path had been defending Qi Sea Ancestor as they made the Righteous Qi Alliance, to contest against the variant human alliance under Fang Yuan’s control.\n\nIt turned out that both leaders were Fang Yuan after all, it could be said that the entirety of Eastern Sea’s righteous path clans were toyed around in the hands of Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter Shen Cong Sheng found out about the truth, he felt anger and humiliation, but soon, fear and unrest followed.\n\nShen clan was an Eastern Sea super force, it had huge businesses and seven seas under its control, but how could they face Fang Yuan?\n\nBack when Fang Yuan was still a pseudo venerable, Eastern Sea’s super forces had joined together unprecedentedly and nominated Qi Sea Ancestor to lead them. This caused their situation to stabilize.\n\nNow that Fang Yuan was a venerable, Shen clan and the other super forces could not escape his wrath.\n\nBecause they were located in Eastern Sea, they could not move elsewhere.\n\nEven if they wanted to move, where could they go?\n\nSouthern Border and Western Desert were impossible, since the absence of a venerable meant that Fang Yuan could chase after them if he was unhappy, and they would be doomed.\n\nOther than those regions, Central Continent and Northern Plains each had their own venerable who could resist Fang Yuan. But they already had their own super forces, how could Shen clan and the rest develop there? If they stayed in Eastern Sea, Fang Yuan would bully them, but if they went to Central Continent or Northern Plains, would Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable not suppress them? The five regions chaotic war was bound to happen, if Shen clan joined either venerable, when war broke out, they would be used as cannon fodder.\n\nThus, Shen Cong Sheng gathered the elite Gu Immortals and discussed for a while, he decided that joining Fang Yuan was the best choice for them.\n\nEven though it was quite embarrassing, Fang Yuan was now a Demon Venerable, everyone would understand their actions.\n\nAfter Shen Cong Sheng made up his mind to join Fang Yuan, he thought about it more deeply: Since he was going to join Fang Yuan, Shen clan had to be the first clan to do so, it would give them more advantages. If Shen clan took the lead and worked with a pseudo venerable like Lu Wei Yin, stirring other Eastern Sea righteous path forces to join Fang Yuan, they would leave a good impression on Fang Yuan.\n\nShen Cong Sheng secretly told this plan to Shen Shang, after he thought about it for a while, he decided that it was possible. Thus, they had to convince Lu Wei Yin first.\n\nShen Shang felt that they had a good chance of convincing Lu Wei Yin.\n\nEven though he had only met Lu Wei Yin shortly, they had a deep connection. Shen Shang had once received Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s guidance while Lu Wei Yin was his Southern Border inheritor.\n\nIf they looked at this from the Central Continent sect system, they were disciple brothers.\n\nFurthermore, during the battle of Crazed Demon Cave, Lu Wei Yin and Shen Shang had worked together without any internal conflict. After returning, Shen Shang used his human path methods to heal Lu Wei Yin. If he were to use only his own earth path methods, it would take a long time to recover!\n\nAt once, Shen Cong Sheng cried while Shen Shang drank tea by the side, they were both waiting for Lu Wei Yin’s response.\n\nLu Wei Yin sighed internally.\n\nHe had already understood that Shen Shang had an unclear relationship with Fang Yuan, they had worked together during the fate war to fight Heavenly Court. In Crazed Demon Cave, after Shen Shang left Divine Emperor City, he immediately cooperated and fought against Heavenly Court as a result of Fang Yuan’s words.\n\nThen what about Lu Wei Yin?\n\nWhere should he go?\n\nLu Wei Yin had been considering this question for a long time.\n\nAfter the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, the situation of the world changed drastically.\n\nThree venerables were in a standoff, but there was still the possibility of other venerables reviving.\n\nEverything needed to be reconsidered.\n\nLu Wei Yin, who had pseudo venerable battle strength, was clear of his own situation. Fighting against a venerable was courting death. But in certain situations, pseudo venerables were still capable of influencing the victory and defeat of venerables.\n\nThe battle in Crazed Demon Cave was proof of this.\n\nWhen Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable got into a deadlock, they first invited Fang Yuan before asking the other pseudo venerables to join their side. These people were the crucial pieces needed to tilt victory in their favor.\n\nIn Crazed Demon Cave, even after the three venerables stopped fighting, Fang Yuan and the other venerables did not deal with Lu Wei Yin and the rest.\n\nOther than the fact that they were in poor condition and were wary of each other’s actions, thus being unable to take risks, if they tried to kill the pseudo venerables and failed, they would be forcing them to join the other sides.\n\nThus, Lu Wei Yin and the rest returned safely.\n\nLu Wei Yin pondered for a while before saying: “If Lord Paradise Earth were still around, I would definitely follow him. The reason why I helped Fang Yuan to ambush Spectral Soul during the pursuit battle was to use his strength to help Lord Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable revive. But now, he has been killed by Fang Yuan…”\n\nLu Wei Yin gritted his teeth, showing anger on his face.\n\nIf Paradise Earth were to be killed by either Giant Sun Immortal Venerable or Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, Lu Wei Yin might still feel better.\n\nBut it was Fang Yuan who killed Paradise Earth.\n\nWhile Fang Yuan managed to escape from Spectral Soul Demon Venerable because of Lu Wei Yin’s desperate attempt to ambush him.\n\nShen Shang observed his expression and knew that Lu Wei Yin’s emotions were surging, he understood why Lu Wei Yin felt so conflicted as well.\n\nShen Shang did not speak. He had received Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s help in the past, it was not appropriate to speak now.\n\nShen Cong Sheng had no such issue, immediately urging: “In my opinion, Lord Lu Wei Yin, you do not need to be too conflicted. Back then, you helped Fang Yuan mostly because of Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s will.”\n\nAfter pausing for a while, he added: “Furthermore, even though Fang Yuan took Lord Paradise Earth’s life, that was merely the final hit. The most important culprits were Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.”\n\nLu Wei Yin sighed as he looked up, he had no choice but to nod as he said: “You are right.”\n\nHe smiled bitterly: “The situation has changed, the world is no longer like before. Without Lord Paradise Earth, I, Lu Wei Yin, am merely a wandering vagrant. Even though Mushroomman Paradise is still around, the mushroommen have all entered the sovereign immortal aperture already, they are Fang Yuan’s hostages. I am troubled by both choices, I cannot calm down. Shen Shang, we have a deep friendship forged from battles, I wonder what your opinion on this matter is? I would like to hear your view.”\n\nShen Shang coughed before saying: “I will not lie to you, friend, I want to join Lord Heaven Refining Demon Venerable. The truth is, back in the blue dragon whale, we had already worked with Lord Fang Yuan. Afterwards, we collaborated in both the fate war and the battle in Crazed Demon Cave. Through our multiple cooperations, Lord Fang Yuan had not let us down once. Of course, can we say that Fang Yuan is dependable? That is complete nonsense, he is still a Demon Venerable after all. But Shen clan’s foundation is here, if we try to move, it will be too risky. After considering the pros and cons, this is the only thing we can do.”\n\nGu Immortals could not cultivate without resources.\n\nShen clan was huge and had many Gu Immortals, they needed even more resources to maintain the cultivation of all their members, while promoting new Gu Immortal seeds as well.\n\nOf course, each Gu Immortal had their own immortal aperture.\n\nBut just the resources inside one’s immortal aperture were not enough to be self-sufficient. Otherwise, treasure yellow heaven would not be this popular with everyone.\n\nThe sovereign immortal aperture was able to be self-sufficient, but it was unique.\n\nEven though it could be refined again, the amount of immortal materials needed, including the ten extreme physiques, and also the tribulation during the Gu refinement, made the risks and investments too great to bear.\n\nHearing Shen Shang’s words, Lu Wei Yin’s expression turned grim as he nodded: “Brother Shen has helped me a lot, since that is your decision, then I will follow you this time.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng and Shen Shang glanced at each other while muttering internally: Sly old fox.\n\nWith these words, Lu Wei Yin wanted to use this decision to repay the favor of having Shen Shang heal his injuries.\n\nAs expected, a pseudo venerable like Lu Wei Yin was a genius among geniuses, he could not be deceived under most situations.\n\nShen Shang coughed and said: “It is for the best that you have decided to do this. We can help each other out in the future as well.”\n\nShen Cong Sheng quickly made use of this conversation, suggesting that Shen Shang and Lu Wei Yin should take the lead to get all the other Eastern Sea super forces to join Fang Yuan as well.\n\nLu Wei Yin predicted that this would happen, he nodded and agreed on the spot.\n\nShen Cong Sheng brewed his six sound tea again.\n\nAfter enjoying the tea, Shen Shang brought the satisfied Lu Wei Yin into their secret room again for treatment.\n\nShen Shang’s and Lu Wei Yin’s injuries were very severe.\n\nJust one round of treatment was not enough. Even if Shen Shang was using human path methods, to get rid of these venerable dao marks on their wounds, time was needed.\n\nOn the morning of the second day, Shen Cong Sheng set off and visited the other super clans.\n\nHis plan to rope them in was quite successful.\n\nThese super forces were all based in Eastern Sea, they soon heard from Shen Cong Sheng that Shen Shang and Lu Wei Yin were going to join Fang Yuan.\n\nWith the death of Demon Immortal Qi Jue in Crazed Demon Cave, there were only three pseudo venerable battle strength experts left in the world.\n\nAmong the three of them, Shen Shang and Lu Wei Yin wanted to join Fang Yuan, while Qi Sea Ancestor, the leader of the Righteous Qi Alliance, was Fang Yuan’s qi path clone!\n\nThis trend was simply too overpowering, the other Eastern Sea super clans soon joined in.\n\nOf course, not everyone wanted to join Fang Yuan.\n\nXia Xuan, Xia Jia, and the other Gu Immortals had already decided to leave Eastern Sea and betray the Righteous Qi Alliance the moment they heard Longevity Heaven’s and Heavenly Court’s announcements.\n\nThese Xia clan Gu Immortals were truly pitiful.\n\nFirst, their foundation was devoured by the variant human alliance, they then joined Qi Sea Ancestor to try and reclaim their territory. But the result was that Qi Sea Ancestor and Fang Yuan had played them entirely, killing the important Gu Immortals of Xia clan like Xia Rui Zhi.\n\n“This demon Fang Yuan killed our clansmen and devoured our foundation, this enmity is greater than heaven!”\n\n“Eastern Sea, we will be back one day!”\n\n“Let’s go, Zui Xian Weng is going to arrive here soon on patrol.”\n\n“Hehe, don’t worry, in order to escape today, I specially found some rare wine for Zui Xian Weng. With his nature, he is going to be completely drunk today.”\n\nXia clan’s Gu Immortals conversed while secretly flying from Eastern Sea to Central Continent along the surface of the sea.\n\nZui Xian Weng watched as they left, until they vanished into the horizon.\n\nThis elderly Gu Immortal sighed deeply, he had a worried expression.\n\nHe had already regretted his promise to Qin Ding Ling. He was now Heavenly Court’s spy that had infiltrated the Righteous Qi Alliance.\n\nHeavenly Court had instructed him a day ago to purposely let these Xia clan Gu Immortals go.\n\n“I succeeded this time because it was an easy mission, but next time?”\n\nZui Xian Weng thought about Fang Yuan, who had venerable cultivation level, all the wine that he had become flavorless.\n\n“How did he suddenly become a venerable out of nowhere?!”"
