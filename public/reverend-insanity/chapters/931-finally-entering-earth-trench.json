  "content": "Chapter 931: Finally Entering Earth Trench\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nEarth shell snails lived in the depths of Earth Trench, or rather, they could only live there.\n\nAccording to what Fang Yuan said, to collect the star night mucus, he would need to enter deep into Earth Trench and find an earth shell snail, trailing behind it as the snail moves, processing the mucus on the spot.\n\nAfter processing it, he had to collect the star night mucus in a very short amount of time.\n\nThere was great difficulty in this, and it was very dangerous.\n\nEarth shell snails had mild temperaments, it was not hard to get near them, one could even stand on their backs and attack them lightly, this desolate beast would not get angry.\n\nThe danger came from the fact that Earth Trench did not only contain earth shell snails.\n\nThe deeper one went into Earth Trench, the more fierce beasts, mysterious plants and wild Gu worms would show up.\n\nEarth Trench was unfathomably deep, the place where the earth shell snails lived was a huge distance from the surface. Around the earth shell snail, there were many powerful beasts that formed into groups of desolate beasts, even ancient desolate beasts were not rare.\n\nThese fierce beasts and plants were the biggest threat.\n\n“I definitely have to go into Earth Trench. Since Lady Blazing Heaven Demoness wants you two to protect me, then I will rely on you. Even if you die, I must live, do you understand?” Fang Yuan ordered them in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\nLandlord Lei Yu and Doctor Yin Xuan gritted their teeth in anger, but they could do nothing to Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan used Blazing Heaven Demoness’ name, these two immortal zombies had no choice.\n\nThe two discussed for a while before Doctor Yin Xuan said with a gloomy face to Fang Yuan: “This is very important, I have to report to Lady Blazing Heaven Demoness first, we cannot decide this ourselves!”\n\nIn the end, the key obstacle was still Blazing Heaven Demoness.\n\nBut this was something Fang Yuan had expected.\n\nThus, he waved his sleeves, urging them: “Then go!”\n\nHe was not afraid of Blazing Heaven Demoness’ investigation.\n\nThe truth was, star night mucus was a real thing.\n\nThis was one of the gains that Fang Yuan had recently when modifying the star thought Immortal Gu recipe.\n\nStar night mucus was a personal innovation by Fang Yuan, it had a lot of potential and had a variety of uses. Not only could it be used for star thought Immortal Gu, it could also be used for the refinement of other star path Immortal Gu, it was an easy to gather rank six immortal material that also had a lot of use.\n\n“If I can find a suitable habitat for earth shell snails, I can make use of it to produce star night mucus continuously. This immortal material would be a monopoly if I sold it in treasure yellow heaven, I can definitely sell it for a good price. In the short run, its value and profit would rival guts Gu.”\n\nFang Yuan evaluated.\n\nBut in the long run, the star night mucus’ method of production would be deciphered by others, they would even mimic him.\n\nAfter all, processing immortal materials was not like producing guts Gu, in the hands of refinement path and wisdom path Gu Immortals, it could be easily deciphered. He could not keep a monopoly for long.\n\nDoctor Yin Xuan stayed and accompanied Fang Yuan. The unlucky fellow, Landlord Lei Yu, carried a sense of heaviness and uneasiness as he went to a certain Gu formation in Dark Flow Giant City, using an information path Gu formation to transmit the information to Blazing Heaven Demoness.\n\nFang Yuan was not worried that Blazing Heaven Demoness would stop him.\n\nIn fact, Fang Yuan was rather confident that she would agree to it.\n\nAfter all, refining star thought Immortal Gu would be of great help to Blazing Heaven Demoness as well. Fang Yuan still owed her a huge debt, if she did not want him to die, she might even send other immortal zombies to protect him.\n\nOf course, there would not be many immortal zombies protecting him.\n\nRight now, Northern Plains Zombie Alliance’s attention was on the demonic path Gu Immortals of Snowy Mountain blessed land, to assault them and prevent them from obtaining Gu refinement immortal materials, so that Old Ancestor Xue Hu would suffer.\n\n“If Blazing Heaven Demoness really did that, it would be in my favor. Entering deep into Earth Trench, the more people there are, the safer it is. By the time I get to the inheritance, I can shrug them off. If there are few people, I can shrug them off more easily.”\n\nAs Fang Yuan had expected, in the end, Blazing Heaven Demoness agreed with his idea and arranged for five immortal zombies to accompany him.\n\nAmong them, two were rank seven, and three were rank six. This was slightly beyond Fang Yuan’s expectations, he could see Blazing Heaven Demoness’ sincerity from this.\n\nThree days later, the five immortal zombies gathered.\n\nThey waited for two more days, as the immortal zombies borrowed some Immortal Gu for this mission.\n\nAs the locals, no one was more familiar with Earth Trench than them.\n\nAfter making ample preparations, the group set off.\n\nWhat was worth noting was, not only did Northern Plains have an Earth Trench, in fact, the five regions all had an Earth Trench.\n\nThe ground was split open into giant ravines, some Earth Trenches stretched on for millions of li, some were tens of thousand of kilometers deep, some were immeasurably deep, in the Gu Master world, it was one of the most magnificent wonders of nature.\n\nThe Earth Trench in Zombie Alliance was closely guarded by them. When Blazing Heaven Demoness was not in Northern Plains, Yin Liu Gong, Dragon Commander Ye Cha, and Huang Quan Weng, the three rank seven immortal zombies, would send at least one person to guard the entrance of Earth Trench.\n\nEarth Trench was full of resources, there were many desolate beasts, in the past, when Dark Flow Giant City was built here, it was to occupy this rich resource point.\n\nEveryone knew that Northern Plains has the least amount of cultivation resources compared to the other four regions. But in Earth Trench, there was a huge area of rich resources. The only drawback was, there were powerful desolate plants and desolate beasts inside, they were numerous.\n\nNormally, only super forces could occupy the Earth Trench resource point.\n\nNorthern Plains Zombie Alliance was like this, the Demon Expelling Sect in Central Continent was the same. Demon Expelling Sect was a super force, having three Gu Immortals standing guard in it, it controlled the Earth Trench known as An Zu Earth Trench, it was very famous in Central Continent.\n\nBy night time, Fang Yuan and the others went through the entrance of Earth Trench.\n\nFang Yuan had planned for a long time, he was not going to sneak in stealthily. He was surrounded by five immortal zombies, he was going in boldly and openly.\n\nThe giant trench was like a giant beast with a bloodthirsty mouth, it slowly opened its mouth in the deep darkness.\n\nFang Yuan and the others went inside, as their view of the trench gradually enlarged, dozens of times, hundreds of times.\n\nAfter they flew down for several minutes, the interior of the Earth Trench was already wide enough to fit seventy or eighty Dark Flow Giant Cities.\n\nThe eerie darkness shined with twinkling glimmers of light.\n\nThe cliffs on the two sides were smooth and bare, there was only a sparse amount of needle shaped plants that were stuck there like sesame seeds.\n\nNobody knew how deep this Earth Trench was.\n\nEven the immortal zombies who were in control of this place for many years had never explored to the bottom of the Earth Trench.\n\nEven though the Earth Trench was full of resources, there was also an unbelievable number of desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts. Northern Plains Zombie Alliance did not have the strength, even though they exerted all their efforts, they only controlled the territory up to about one hundred and sixty kilometers from the surface.\n\nIn this current world, even though humans had been the overlords for a long time, they were not able to gain control over every area in nature.\n\nCompared to the majesty of nature, humans were very insignificant and small.\n\nThe profound mysteries of heaven and earth were endless, they were deeply hidden. Even Immortal Venerables and Demon Venerables were merely at the peaks of one or two paths, being able to observe the rules of the world.\n\nHumans were far from understanding the mysteries of heaven and earth, there was a long road ahead of them.\n\nAs the group moved deeper, Earth Trench became wider and it showed just how small Fang Yuan and the rest were.\n\nHere, they were already around a hundred kilometers from the surface. Mountains could not fill up this Earth Trench, it was shrouded in boundless darkness, devouring everything.\n\nEveryone was very quiet.\n\nFang Yuan looked around without making a sound, he observed the immortal zombies secretly using his peripheral vision.\n\nFive immortal zombie guards, two rank seven, three rank six.\n\nAmong them, the rank seven immortal zombies were Dragon Commander Ye Cha and Granny Yuan.\n\nAmong the three rank sixes, there was Doctor Yin Xuan and Landlord Lei Yu, as well as an enslavement path immortal zombie, called Lin Da Niao.\n\nIn the last five days, Fang Yuan had obtained some of their information, he was not clueless about them.\n\nAmong the two rank seven immortal zombies, the leader was Dragon Commander Ye Cha.\n\nHe was one of the three vice-leaders of Dark Flow Giant City, and also the strongest person in this trip. What was worth mentioning was that he used his own immortal aperture to raise large numbers of yaksha octopuses, gaining a reputation because of them.\n\nImmortal zombies had dead apertures, but Dragon Commander Ye Cha was able to raise large amounts of yaksha octopuses, this was something others found puzzling, and many immortal zombies were curious.\n\nThe other rank seven immortal zombie was Granny Yuan, skilled in defense.\n\nDoctor Yin Xuan, as his title suggested, was a healing Gu Immortal. He could not compare to Tai Bai Yun Sheng, but in regards to healing immortal zombies, he had quite the skill.\n\nLandlord Lei Yu was skilled in attacking, his attacks were grand and powerful.\n\nThe final person, the immortal zombie Lin Da Niao, he was skilled in controlling birds, he was an enslavement path immortal zombie.\n\nFrom this, one could see that Blazing Heaven Demoness had put in some effort in arranging these people to protect Fang Yuan.\n\nGranny Yuan could provide him defense, while Doctor Yin Xuan could help Fang Yuan recover from injuries at a crucial moment, saving his life. If they were attacked by desolate beasts and were unable to win, Lin Da Niao could sacrifice the bird groups that he had, providing enough time to allow the immortals to make an escape.\n\nThe deeper they went, the wider Earth Trench became.\n\nThere was a lot of space between the two cliffs on the sides, birds could move very freely here.\n\nAt this moment, birds were flying out of Lin Da Niao’s immortal aperture, flying around the place.\n\nEnslavement path had its conveniences, ever since they entered Earth Trench, Lin Da Niao was in charge of the investigation aspect.\n\n“The inheritance is that way, but I cannot go there directly, it would seem like I have an objective and they would be suspicious.” Fang Yuan did not do anything suspicious, he was very patient.\n\nAfter some traveling, Lin Da Niao suddenly said: “There is a yaksha octopus in front and towards the left, it is injured.”\n\nDragon Commander Ye Cha’s expression did not change: “Ignore it, we will detour around it.”\n\nFang Yuan’s group of six was very powerful, a rank six yaksha octopus was surely inferior to them.\n\nBut this trip was to find earth shell snails and gather immortal materials, that was their objective.\n\nBy that point, they were sure to go through many battles, they should save their immortal essence for now.\n\nEarth shell snails lived deep in Earth Trench, they moved very slowly and did not have fixed locations, they were very hard to trace.\n\nThe stronger the beast, the more they would have a sense of territory.\n\nIn an extremely deep part of Earth Trench, all sorts of fierce beasts and plants owned their respective territories.\n\nBut earth shell snails were a rare species that could move between territories without attracting the animosity of the desolate beasts.\n\nMaybe it was because of the earth shell snail’s gentle nature, it let the other strong living beings know that it was harmless.\n\nBut Fang Yuan and the others would not receive treatment like the earth shell snail.\n\nThus, there were bound to be battles."
