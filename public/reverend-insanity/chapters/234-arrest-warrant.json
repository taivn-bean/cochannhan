Those people buy it because it is more convenient for them, and they can save time from picking them. Sigh, it’s pointless to tell you now. Nevermind, nevermind….”\n\nThe old village head continuously sighed.\n\nFang Yuan bobbed his head: “We just wanted to sell it for more primeval stones, one is to recoup the cost, the other is to take care of our parents. Who would have thought that after so much effort, it could not be sold.”\n\nHe sounded anxious, a hint of crying in his speech.\n\nHearing his words, the old village head’s heart softened, the grudge in his heart dispersing by more than half.\n\nFang Yuan said again: “No worries lord village head, I have decided to follow the caravan tomorrow. By lowering the price, I’m sure we can sell it eventually.”\n\n“Follow the caravan? Who allowed you to follow the caravan?” The old village head stared with wide opened eyes.\n\nFang Yuan said as a matter of fact: “I saw many mortals in the caravan. If they can follow, why can we?”\n\nThe old village head rested his head on his arm: “Those are the family servants of the lord Gu Masters! You think simply anyone can just follow them? What if people with ill intentions mix in among them?”\n\n“Ah?!” Fang Yuan’s mouth opened wide, stunned on the spot: “Then how? The caravan is leaving tomorrow.”\n\n” _Sigh_ …” The old man sighed deeply: “Nevermind, I’ll help you to the end. Tomorrow I’ll beg them to let you into the caravan, it’ll all be up to your fate.”\n\nThe sun had just rose, and there were still a few stars visible in the light blue sky. Looking afar, Zi You mountain is enveloped in a dark purple colour, peaceful and mysterious.\n\nAfter a night of rest, the caravan had started loading up their goods already.\n\n“Inspect the goods once more!”\n\n“Tie the ropes tightly, if anything drops during the journey, we will punish you with a hundred beatings.”\n\n“Quick, quick, quick, feed our black skin beetles till full.”\n\nGu Masters ordered and sent their family servants into a busy state. Some had bad temper, holding a whip in their hands, whoever moved slowly would be whipped. Some loved their Gu worms, and fed them personally.\n\n“Lord Chen.” The old village head bowed, paying respects to one of the vice leaders in the caravan.\n\n“Oh, old Zhang, I am busy here, just tell me what you have to say.” This Chen Gu Master said.\n\n“It is like this. I have two juniors, doing small business…” Before the old village head finished, Chen Gu Master suddenly shouted: “Chen Xin, why are you in a daze? Go and feed the winged snakes, you think those servants can feed them properly? That snake of yours had already swallowed three servants these few days!”\n\n“Yes clan elder.” Chen Xin was grabbed, raising his head and said.\n\nBut Chen Gu Master did not let go of him, chiding again: “How many times have I told you, call me clan elder in the village, in the caravan, you have to address me as vice leader.”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes Lord vice leader.” Chen Xin answered, running away swiftly.\n\n“This rascal…” Chen Gu Master scolded under his breath in anger, before turning to the old village head: “What did you say earlier? Oh! You want me to vouch for your two juniors to enter the caravan?”\n\n“Lord is truly wise, that is the case.” Old village head quickly answered.\n\n“That…” Chen Gu Master purposely hummed.\n\nThe old village head was turned into a Gu Master by him, because this route needed for the caravan to pass by, he needed someone who worked for him.\n\nFor caravans travelling, those villages were crucial, but the mortal hamlets along the way cannot be ignored as well, they were equally important.\n\nThe caravans had many people and much to do, much living resources would be quickly expended and need to be replenished along the way. There are also servants, when they encounter danger, some servants die and manpower becomes lacking. The caravan will have to select some mortals in those hamlets to recruit.\n\nSpeaking of which, among Chen Gu Master’s family servants, manpower was starting to feel lacking, after all mortals had cheap lives, they were just a type of expendable resources that can talk and move.\n\n“Henceforth, when I cross by Zi You mountain, I will still need to make use of old Zhang, if I don’t accede to his request, wouldn’t that discourage him? Although I am lacking manpower now, I cannot agree so easily. I have to wait, and sell this favor at a good price.”\n\nChen Gu Master was still considering, when a messenger Gu Master from the caravan came running.\n\nThere was a stack of paper in his hand, as he ran and shouted: “All members take note, there is a new arrest warrant, there is a new arrest warrant!”\n\nHe shouted as he pasted a piece of paper on a black skin fat beetle’s body.\n\n“New arrest warrant? From which clan? How much bounty, retrieve it for me.” Chen Gu Master was interested.\n\n“Yes, vice leader.” The messenger Gu Master quickly handed over a piece of paper.\n\nChen Gu Master looked: “Oh, an arrest warrant from Bai clan. As long as information is accurate, they will give a thousand primeval stones? So much!”\n\nChen Gu Master’s eyes shone, gaining interest in the matter.\n\nThere were two prices on the warrant, one was information price, the other was killing price.\n\nInformation priced at a thousand primeval stones, normally it is used for a wanted demonic cultivator that has made a name for himself. But this poster only showed two youngsters, with proper features, and one was even very beautiful.\n\nOne male one female, these were two newbies.\n\n“One is a rank one Gu Master, the other is rank three. With information price of a thousand primeval stones, and killing price of five thousand eight thousand primeval stones. Pfft, it seems that Bai clan hates these two demonic rascals to the core. Hehe…” Chen Gu Master laughed at their predicament, so long as it is not his Chen family.\n\nWhat he did not know was, these two demonic rascals were near him.\n\nThe old village head took a look at the arrest warrant, and a chill came from within his heart.\n\n“Gu Master’s world is really dangerous, such a beautiful youngster, is actually a criminal demonic cultivator! Let’s just hope that they are not coming to our village.”\n\n“Alright, seeing how you’ve worked hard for all these years old Zhang, I will accede to your request.” Chen Gu Master said.\n\n“Ah, thank you lord! Lord, I will call them here now.” The old village head was overjoyed.\n\nChen Gu Master waved his hand: “No need, I’m very busy. Just get them to report to Chen Xin.”\n\nTowards two mortals, he held no interest. At the same time, he did not connect them to the arrest warrant in his hand, after all this is the Bai clan’s request, and they were thousands of li away. Chen Gu Master subconsciously felt that he at a very safe distance away.\n\nThis was a very common thinking.\n\nEven on modern Earth, when murder cases happen in cities, no matter how ruthless and vile it is, other cities do not feel much danger, even if transportation is so advanced.\n\nOther than that, they also have a fluke mind mentality.\n\nIn this vast world, where people lived everywhere, how would these two demonic scoundrels come to my caravan? Then I would be way too unlucky, it’s impossible!\n\nPeople always tend to think that unlucky events would not occur on themselves.\n\nMoreover, many people in arrest warrants are extremely vicious and cruel characters, attracting people’s attention. Two newbies like Fang and Bai, one rank three and one rank one, what could they amount to?\n\nChen Xin saw the two of them but did not think of the warrant at all.\n\nFang and Bai’s image had changed completely, not just the disfigured Fang Yuan, but after these days of practising, she also started to become more natural.\n\nChen Xin lost interest immediately, especially Fang Yuan’s appearance made him disgusted.\n\nHe was only rank one, while Fang Yuan rose to rank two several days ago.\n\nChen Xin observed them carelessly, and did not feel any Gu Master aura, thus calling an old attendant and getting him to arrange Fang and Bai’s jobs.\n\n“What are your names?” The old attendant asked.\n\nOnly at this time did someone ask for their names.\n\n“My name is Hei Tu, my wife is called Bai Yun.” Fang Yuan casually said.\n\n“Female?” The old attendant frowned.\n\nHe stared at Bai Ning Bing and looked, seeing her dark skin appearance and her dazed look, she’s called _Bai Yun_ 1 ? This Hei Tu is also really ugly!\n\n“Women are trouble, you have to be more careful. If something happens, don’t blame me for not reminding you guys!” The old attendant said.\n\n“I know, this cart beside me is filled with purple maple leaves. My wife is staying on the cart and taking care of the goods, I do not want much interaction with other people.” Fang Yuan said.\n\n“Hmph, good that you understand.”\n\nThe old attendant arranged a physical task for the two, to move goods, but for Fang Yuan and Bai Ning Bing, it is no issue at all, but Bai Ning Bing had to pretend and act like she was out of breath constantly, causing her mental fatigue.\n\nNot far away, some family servants were slacking, resting at a corner.\n\nTheir gazes were directed towards Fang and Bai.\n\n“Brother Qiang, there’s two newcomers. Some people saw them bringing in their private goods! That’s an entire cart of purple maple leaves.” A thin family servant said excitedly.\n\nDepriving newcomers, it was the ritual that the caravan old timers often did.\n\nBrother Qiang squatted on the ground, squinting: “I see it. Skinny monkey, go test them out.”\n\nHis body was strong as an ox, although his muscles were developed, he was not a rash person.\n\nIn this world where Gu Masters ruled above all, the strength of a mortal is nothing spectacular. Being able to become the most important person in this small circle, he had some wits after all.\n\nSkinny monkey sighed, under everyone’s supervision, he got near to Fang Yuan.\n\n“Hey brother, where are you from? Others call me brother monkey, from now on we will be working together, I hope we can work together amicably.” Skinny monkey forced out a smile.\n\nFang Yuan gave him a glance, only saying a word: “Scram.”\n\nSkinny monkey’s eyes expanded as he showed a look of rage.\n\nFang Yuan did not look at him, but continued moving his goods. He had worked in the caravan in his previous life, extremely clear of such “rituals”.\n\nIn plain words, skinny monkey was testing water, using words to test out Fang Yuan’s identity, if he did not have any backing, they would work together and bully him, depriving him of some benefits.\n\nBut the truth is, not only are humans like this, Gu Masters were the same, they just did it more elegantly.\n\nMoving alone and risking their lives, it included fighting with wild beasts. Moving together in groups, it was competing with their own kind.\n\nAt places with benefits, there were conflicts. There is only so much space after all, everyone wants to live better, and have more room to themselves, what can they do?\n\nThey can only invade other people’s spaces.\n\nSkinny monkey had not expected Fang Yuan to not give face, thus he was stunned at the spot, staring intently at Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan did not give a thought about such a character. Mortals were cheap as grass, even if one or two were killed, so what?\n\nAs long as the goods were still delivered, the Gu Masters in charge would not care.\n\nEven if they did, Fang Yuan had back up methods to resolve this issue.\n\nAll in all, trying to provoke Fang Yuan, these family servants were courting death.\n\n“What, why are you not scramming, you want me to chase you away?” Fang Yuan gave skinny monkey a cold look again.\n\nSkinny monkey snorted, but did not explode in anger, instead taking his leave.\n\nSuch a strong attitude, it caused brother Qiang to feel threatened: Did these two have some sort of background? Otherwise how could they be so arrogant? I had better check up on their backgrounds first."
