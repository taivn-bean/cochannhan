They flew extremely fast, leaving behind afterimages in the air, and had no fear when they charged towards their enemies.\n\n“Kill, kill, kill!” Hei Lou Lan shouted, the black smoke around his body was rolling, creating multiple black tentacles as they one after another captured the surrounding wind scythe birds and devoured them.\n\nThe battle of the army fighting against the wind scythe birds had been ongoing for an hour, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n\nThe floor was littered with bird corpses, but there were also many dead Gu Masters.\n\n“Ahhhhh…” Hei Lou Lan screamed, he was going berserk from fighting, stretching out his right hand.\n\nHis right arm was in a claw shape, as a dark spiral was formed, it rotated in the air and converged at the center of his right claw.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, thousands of dark streams gathered like they were flowing into the sea, into Hei Lou Lan’s right claw like a black light ball.\n\nThe light ball was dark and mysterious, it spun on its own and gave out a thunder like sound.\n\n“Go!” Hei Lou Lan’s eyes suddenly opened wide as he shouted, using all his strength to point his claw at the sky.\n\nHe grabbed the round ball of black light like he was lifting heavy weight, his movement was very slow and strenuous.\n\nFollowing this movement, the light ball slowly flew into the air.\n\nIn the air, it rapidly expanded, in a few breaths’ time, it expanded to the size of a mountain.\n\nAt once, the black light ball occupied the sky covering half the alliance army’s surface area.\n\nCountless wind scythe birds were engulfed by it, melting and corroding, not even their bones were left intact.\n\nThe entire process was silent and strangely overbearing, people’s hearts were turning cold from seeing this.\n\nThis was Hei Lou Lan’s signature killer move — Dark Vortex!\n\nAfter lasting for six breaths’ time, the vortex killed tens of thousands of wind scythe birds.\n\nThe numbers of the wind scythe birds were too huge, and because they gathered above the alliance army, they were a terrifying threat.\n\nAfter the dark vortex vanished, a huge clear hole appeared in the sky, but soon, the wind scythe birds flooded in like a tide, covering up the hole again. Above the alliance army, there were countless wind scythe birds again.\n\nThis was the twenty-fifth round of the sixty-eighth floor of Eighty-Eight True Yang Building.\n\nThe numbers of wind scythe birds were too great, among them were large numbers of bird kings, their assault was too powerful.\n\nActually, according to their experiences, they knew there had to be an easier way to challenge this round, but Hei Lou Lan directly charged in and mobilized all his strength to overwhelm the birds.\n\nThis attracted the revenge and counterattack of the frenzied wind scythe birds.\n\n“Hahaha, kill all these damn birds!” At one side, Ye Lui Sang laughed. Hei Lou Lan’s explosive strength triggered his fighting spirit.\n\nYe Lui tribe was on the same level as Hei tribe, they were both super forces, having Gu Immortals backing them. Ye Lui Sang and Hei Lou Lan had the same status, they were both the tribe leader of their respective super tribes.\n\nWhen he saw Hei Lou Lan’s killer move that killed countless wind scythe birds, he was not willing to hold back anymore.\n\n“Look at my newly developed killer move — Flame Demon!”\n\nYe Lui Sang shouted loudly as his sleeves fluttered, and his primeval essence rushed into the Gu worms in his hands.\n\nWith a loud thud, his body was clad in flames as the flames burst out, all Gu Masters near him moved away.\n\nWithin the radius of a few hundred steps, he was the only person left.\n\nHis body trembled and the flames that could rise to heaven split to form a ten metre bronze ape that was completely made of flames.\n\nThe flaming bronze ape had an ugly appearance, with teeth like a gorilla, strange horns and bulging muscles. This was the flame demon!\n\nThe flame demon rose into the sky, crashing around as all the wind scythe birds that collided with it were ignited, screaming from being burnt alive.\n\nAlong its path, flames were burning, causing a straight line of them to form in the sky. Large numbers of wind scythe birds were roasted, falling to the ground.\n\nThe flame demon rampaged arrogantly, attracting the attention of many birds, it greatly reduced the pressure of the Gu Masters in the grand army.\n\n“What fire demon, it is nothing much!” Far away, Hei Lou Lan laughed loudly, showing his smug arrogance.\n\nYe Lui Sang laughed as well: “Hei tribe leader, take another look!”\n\nIn saying this, his body shook as the flames fell off him, forming another flame demon.\n\nHei Lou Lan’s expression changed, not just him, even Fang Yuan who was in the army took a serious look. The flame demon had great strength, but to think he had more than one.\n\nEighty-Eight True Yang Building gave lots of opportunities, it was not just Fang Yuan and Hei Lou Lan who were improving, other Gu Masters were gaining many rewards as well.\n\nWhen six flame demons entered the battlefield, the flames on Ye Lui Sang were finally extinguished.\n\n“Six flame demons, thankfully…” Fang Yuan retracted his gaze.\n\nHei Lou Lan’s expression soothed as well.\n\nYe Lui Sang had true capability, this killer move was really extraordinary, but that was as far as it got. In terms of power, it could only be on par with dark vortex.\n\nThe flame demons rampaged for an hour as their strength fell more and more, eventually perishing among the wind scythe birds.\n\nBut soon after, Fang Yuan, Tai Bai Yun Sheng, Xi Xue, Pei Yan Fei, Tao You, Gu Guo Long and others attacked, using all their killer moves. The great strength of rank five experts quickly changed the battlefield, tilting the scales of victory towards the alliance army.\n\nEventually, they succeeded, getting into the twenty-sixth round.\n\n“Reporting to lord tribe leader, thirteen tribe leaders have submitted a letter of request, they are asking for a temporarily halt of advancement. They are worried about the huge casualties, they need to rest and recover.” Before Hei Lou Lan had finished probing this round, his attendant Hei Shu had already reported.\n\nHei Lou Lan frowned immediately, shouting: “Begrudging already despite such few casualties! These useless bums, they are all useless cowards! Return this request to them, and tell them we will advance no matter what. Whoever dares to escape or run away from the alliance army will have their entire tribe and any related tribes executed, none will be spared!”\n\nSaying so, he held the letter in his hand and tore it into pieces immediately.\n\n“Continue advancing, charge!” Hei Lou Lan waved his hand, shouting as he commanded the army.\n\nHe was anxious.\n\nThese days, Eighty-Eight True Yang Building would emit a strange tremor every few days.\n\nCoupled with the disappearance of the owner token, Hei Lou Lan felt that this was not a simple matter, his instincts were telling him that something unthinkable was about to happen.\n\nTo avoid any accidents in the future, he had to quickly get the strength path Immortal Gu now. Only after advancing to a Gu Immortal would he have the strength to control this changing situation.\n\nThe challenge this time lasted until the twenty-eighth round. Only after everyone was unable to continue and the casualties were too heavy did Hei Lou Lan have no choice but to retreat and recuperate.\n\n…\n\nIn his room, Tai Bai Yun Sheng showed a bitter smile as he held several east window Gu in his hand.\n\nThese east window Gu contained the cultivation experience of previous generation Gu Masters, among them, most were time path attainment!\n\nThese were all the round rewards obtained from Eighty-Eight True Yang Building.\n\n“Don’t tell me, this is the arrangement of destiny, for me to advance to Gu Immortal realm?”\n\nBack then, Tai Bai Yun Sheng had failed in searching for a lifespan Gu, after wasting all his life’s savings, he had to become Hei tribe’s external elder.\n\nHe was a time path Gu master, rank five peak stage, with his sensitivity towards time he knew that he had little time left since a few years ago.\n\nAlthough advancing to Gu Immortal realm could allow a Gu Master’s life to improve qualitatively, it could not increase his lifespan. But Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s situation was a little special.\n\nHis time path inheritance was extraordinary, it was a Gu immortal inheritance.\n\nThe core of his inheritance had three Gu, river as before Gu, mountain as before Gu, and man as before Gu.\n\nThe inheritance has theorized long ago: When he becomes an immortal, using the supreme opportunity of the resonance of heaven and earth, he could advance his man as before Gu into an Immortal Gu.\n\nThe mortal man as before Gu could only be used on others.\n\nImmortal Gu Man As Before, could be used on himself.\n\n“If I have the man as before Immortal Gu, I can use it on myself and extend my lifespan. Unfortunately, man as before is not like the Spring Autumn Cicada, I cannot save Gao Yang and Zhu Zai. Sigh…”\n\nThinking of this, Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s heart was worried, the intense regret and guilt assaulted him once again.\n\n…\n\nFang Yuan stood at the peak of the tall tower, looking at Hei tribe.\n\nLuck inspection Gu had been activated for a while, it gave him a different field of vision from others.\n\nThis rank five mortal Gu was the sole, unexpected gain that he obtained inside the true inheritance secluded domain.\n\nLuck inspection, as the name suggests, could be used to inspect luck. It was an investigative Gu worm.\n\nIn his vision, in the living quarters of Hei tribe, there were countless smoke-like luck strands. But among them, two were extremely thick, like cranes among chickens, even the palace’s rooms could not hide them.\n\nOne came from Hei Lou Lan, his luck was like a huge pillar, with an azure color, it was thick and long. The other came from Tai Bai Yun Sheng, his luck was like the flames burning during sunset, red and bright, it accumulated above the roof of his house, it was like the feeling of dazzling flames.\n\n“The luck of these two are extremely high, but they are different. Hei Lou Lan’s luck has a lasting feeling. Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s luck is like a pile of old firewood, burning at the last moment. In recent days, I secretly manipulated the rewards and placed many time path attainment experiences as rewards to give them to Tai Bai Yun Sheng. Every time he gets one, the firey red luck above him turns brighter by a bit. The possibility of becoming an immortal also increased slightly.”\n\nFang Yuan thought about it for a long time, he sighed in his heart when he thought about the mysterious and unfathomable luck path.\n\nBut he had only obtained a single luck inspection Gu, he did not know the details of the inheritance, it was like opening a new window, towards this new path, he could only explore it slowly.\n\nHe used the luck inspection Gu on himself.\n\nFang Yuan’s body was shrouded in black ink-like luck. This luck gathered and formed a huge coffin shape, completely covering his body, they were emitting a dense death energy, the energy of great misfortune.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan had looked at this many times, his heart always sank when he observed this.\n\n“My luck is not looking optimistic. But these days, all my talks with the Imperial Court land spirit have had no progress. This land spirit is too arrogant, it only wants to break the seal and regain its freedom. True Yang Building has already shaken thirty-eight times, eventually, Giant Sun’s will would awaken.”\n\n“Eh?” Fang Yuan gasped, he looked at a group of Gu Masters, they were all shrouded in a black coffin-like luck, heading in the direction of Hei tribe.\n\nA moment later, they all entered Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s residence.\n\nFang Yuan thought about briefly before understanding their intentions.\n\n“This is a good opportunity for me to understand the meaning of this black coffin luck.” Fang Yuan’s gaze was dark, he gave a deep glance towards Tai Bai Yun Sheng’s location."
