Most of the time, he used sword escape Immortal Gu.\n\nHe passed several dangerous areas along the way, there were also lone Gu Immortals or super forces around. Fang Yuan did not dare to use Immortal Gu openly, he used mortal killer moves.\n\nHis strategy was correct, after the horned six-winged pegasus and wild Dragon Centipede, no other unexpected surprises occurred.\n\nHeaven’s will needed time to lay out traps.\n\nOn the other hand, there was a limit for heaven’s will’s influence on other life forms.\n\nLike the influence on the horned six-winged pegasus and wild Dragon Centipede, heaven’s will could not order either of them to attack Fang Yuan.\n\nHeaven’s will’s influence was based off situational decisions.\n\nFang Yuan’s speed was very fast, heaven’s will could not create obstacles in time.\n\nHeaven’s will could think and plot.\n\nThis was because of Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nAccording to the intel provided by Shadow Sect, before Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, heaven’s will was much easier to deal with. But after her, heaven’s will became much more ‘crafty’.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan was not purely flying straight ahead.\n\nHe curved and took detours, moving forward in arcs.\n\nIf he moved straight, his route would be easily deduced by heaven’s will, it would lay out dangers along the way and wait for Fang Yuan to fall in.\n\nIn fact, heaven’s will might even deduce that Fang Yuan’s true destination was Tai Qiu and set up arrangements there.\n\nThat would be dangerous!\n\nNot only would Fang Yuan be unable to complete the sect mission, his life would be in danger.\n\nHowever, with Fang Yuan’s fast advancement, heaven’s will could not stop him.\n\nOf course, Fang Yuan would not purposely backtrack. If heaven’s will formed an arragement that was behind him, he would be going into a trap that he had already evaded, that would be stupid!\n\nThis way, his route was very far, the total length of his journey was extended multiple times.\n\nHowever, in the end, Fang Yuan’s speed was still very fast.\n\nThus, three days after encountering the wild dragon centipede Immortal Gu, along the horizon, Tai Qiu entered Fang Yuan’s vision.\n\nTai Qiu was in sight!\n\nA vast amount of ordinary grass formed a huge yellow plain.\n\nTai Qiu’s appearance was like a jade green tower standing tall in a thick forest. In this yellow plain, it was very eye-catching.\n\nAs Fang Yuan got closer, the green Tai Qiu expanded in the horizon, becoming bigger in Fang Yuan’s field of vision. It was like dye that was spreading rapidly on paper.\n\nEventually, Tai Qiu filled Fang Yuan’s vision completely.\n\nA vast amount of giant grass covered this area, figures of beasts were roaming inside, tigers were roaring as wolves howled, there was a stream of continuous noise.\n\nFar and wide, it was a grand scene of the wilderness!\n\nAt this moment, there was no point for Fang Yuan to hide it from heaven’s will.\n\nHis speed became slower, he stopped using Immortal Gu, directly entering Tai Qiu.\n\nCompared to the giant grass, he was tiny. Compared to the entirety of Tai Qiu, he was like a fly that had entered a palace.\n\nThe lush giant grass blocked out the sky.\n\nThe entirety of Tai Qiu was concealing an unknown number of fierce beasts and mutated plants.\n\nThere was a commotion ahead, it seemed like a beast tide was about to form.\n\nFang Yuan smiled coldly, activating dark limit Immortal Gu.\n\nImmortal Gu Dark Limit!\n\nIt could conceal aura and hide from others to prevent deductions, it could also hide one from heaven’s will to a degree.\n\nChange form Immortal Gu!\n\nFang Yuan turned into a coiling mountain goat, entering Tai Qiu.\n\nThe commotion ahead slowly faded.\n\n“If heaven’s will could feel emotions, it must be shocked and furious now.” Fang Yuan smiled, before shaking his head and sighing: “Unfortunately, heaven’s will has no emotions…”\n\nDark limit Immortal Gu helped Fang Yuan greatly.\n\nBack then, when Hei Lou Lan was still a mortal, she relied on this Immortal Gu to conceal her Great Strength True Martial Physique aura, thus surviving.\n\nWhy did the calamities and tribulations of the ten extreme physiques surpass ordinary people?\n\nBecause heaven’s will takes away surpluses while replenishing deficits, it did not want an existence like one of the ten extreme physique to upset the balance of the world.\n\nFang Yuan’s sovereign immortal aperture surpassed the ten extreme physiques. The power of his calamities and tribulations were much greater than the ten extreme physiques. Even dark limit Immortal Gu had limited effect.\n\nFang Yuan suddenly thought: “Fairy Jiang Yu was a member of Shadow Sect, to resist heaven’s will, Shadow Sect definitely had many tools such as dark limit Immortal Gu. If Ying Wu Xie can escape from this predicament and make use of Shadow Sect’s remnant forces, his future might be unhindered, he would have an easier time ahead.”\n\nHe had turned into a coiling mountain goat, this was a common desolate beast in Tai Qiu, even though he was in disguise, he blended in perfectly.\n\nUnlike his Gu Immortal body, which was completely different and eye-catching in Tai Qiu.\n\nSoon, he encountered a desolate beast.\n\nA golden sand dark stallion.\n\nThis was a huge horse.\n\nIts body was larger than the coiling mountain goat that Fang Yuan became. It has bulging muscles and strong bones, its skin was dark gold, it had six hooves that were dark and deep.\n\nThe golden sand dark stallion was eating grass.\n\nSensing the coiling mountain goat that Fang Yuan had turned into, the golden sand dark stallion raised its head, observing this ‘uninvited guest’.\n\nDesolate beasts had their respective territories, the coiling mountain goat had invaded the golden sand dark stallion’s territory.\n\nBut the golden sand dark stallion did not eat meat, it also had a calm temperament, the coiling mountain goat was also a herbivore, the golden sand dark stallion subconsciously felt that the coiling mountain goat had no threat.\n\nBut it was still very alert.\n\nIt stared at Fang Yuan until he went far away from it, before lowering its head to eat grass again.\n\nFang Yuan chose to become a coiling mountain goat, he had considered it deeply.\n\nActually, in Northern Plains, there were lots of wolf desolate beasts, but if he became a desolate beast wolf, he would face an intense reaction from the golden sand dark stallion.\n\nGetting past the golden sand dark stallion, Fang Yuan continued to move forward.\n\nHe had already memorized the map of Tai Qiu. Even in the case that he could not remember something, he had it copied in many information path Gu worms in his immortal aperture.\n\n“The first location is in the southeast direction.” Fang Yuan looked around.\n\nBut the giant grass became taller and taller, the giant grass in the periphery were tall as trees, but as he went in, the giant grass became as tall as towers. The giant grass in the center of Tai Qiu were as tall as hills or mountains.\n\nThe coiling mountain goat’s body was not small, but as Fang Yuan went deeper, the surrounding giant grass became taller and thicker, the coiling mountain goat looked smaller and petite.\n\nAlong the way, Fang Yuan encountered many desolate beasts.\n\nThese desolate beasts were either in groups or alone. Most of them were herbivores, but there were some carnivores as well.\n\nFang Yuan made use of his mind, his intelligence far surpassed desolate beasts.\n\nThus, after some hurdles, he managed to get through them.\n\nBaa baa baa…\n\nThe cries of goats entered Fang Yuan’s ears.\n\nIn the grass ahead, there was a huge group of coiling mountain goats.\n\nFang Yuan sighed in his mind: “It seems that I am deep into Tai Qiu already, this is the first large group of desolate beasts I’ve seen.”\n\nThis goat group had about a hundred of them together, some were eating grass, some were lying on the ground sunbathing, while some young ones were playing around.\n\nFang Yuan entered their field of vision.\n\nThe wild coiling mountain goats looked at him.\n\nThis was the first time they were seeing this unknown goat.\n\nFang Yuan moved carefully.\n\nEven though he had change form Immortal Gu, there was a hidden threat. If one of the goats in this group had a wild investigative Immortal Gu, and could see through Fang Yuan’s concealment, it would be a disaster.\n\nTo play safe, Fang Yuan secretly activated attitude Gu.\n\nImmediately, the goat group felt Fang Yuan’s ‘attitude’ and looked at him with warmer gazes.\n\nFang Yuan took a few steps forward, there were several young desolate beast coiling mountain goats that ran to him, observing him with huge curious eyes, two of them were running around Fang Yuan, jumping around.\n\nFang Yuan walked away from them safely, leaving the goat group.\n\nThe young coiling mountain goats moved with him for a while, as he got away from the goats, they were called back by their parents and returned.\n\nFang Yuan sighed as he felt some pity.\n\nIf he could bring two or three of these younglings with him, and raise them inside the sovereign immortal aperture, that would be great.\n\nRegretfully, he did not have a chance to do so.\n\nLeaving the territory of the coiling mountain goats, Fang Yuan was very close to the first location indicated on the map already.\n\nHe was not careless, he inspected himself.\n\n“Dark limit Immortal Gu’s power of concealment is weakening, but it can still last for some time.” Fang Yuan had an accurate assessment.\n\nAfter activating dark limit Immortal Gu once, it needed to rest for some time before Fang Yuan could use it again.\n\nIts power was left behind in Fang Yuan, concealing his aura. But as time passed, or due to other forces, the concealment would weaken.\n\nAnd depending on the target, the protection effect varied.\n\nFor example, it had been more effective on Hei Lou Lan when she was a mortal. If used on dark path Gu Immortals, the effect would be lower. If used on Gu Immortals of other paths, the effect would be even worse. Thankfully, Fang Yuan’s dao marks did not conflict, otherwise, the effect would be horrible.\n\nIn conclusion, Fang Yuan had to complete his mission while dark limit Immortal Gu’s power was still concealing him.\n\nOtherwise, after the concealment fades, heaven’s will would focus on him, and the countless desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts would attack Fang Yuan together, the situation would be dire.\n\nAfter a moment, Fang Yuan got close to the first location.\n\nBefore reaching, Fang Yuan already knew that the location had completely changed.\n\nBecause the map indicated that there was the corpse of an immemorial desolate beast, a qi grand lion, here.\n\nWhat guarded the corpse was a group of qi grand lions, they were a mix of desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts.\n\nBut the hill-like corpse was gone. There were no qi grand lions either, Fang Yuan used his investigative killer moves and heard some faint wolf howls.\n\nFang Yuan’s heart sank.\n\n“Desolate beast black blood wolves! And this scale… at least thirty of them.”\n\nA group of desolate beast wolves.\n\nEven though the size was not large, they are fierce carnivores.\n\nThe territory of wolves was larger.\n\nFang Yuan did not need to observe them from close by, he just needed to use mortal investigative methods and hearing to get a lot of information.\n\nThis was the intelligence of humans.\n\nWithin this group of desolate beast wolves, there might be wild Immortal Gu, but they could not be activated at will. Compared to Gu Immortals who controlled Immortal Gu, it was a different story.\n\nFang Yuan thought to himself: “The first location has changed. Be it the immemorial desolate beast level qi grand lion’s corpse, those desolate beasts, or the ancient desolate beast qi grand lions, they have all vanished for some reason. Three hundred thousand years later, a small group of black blood wolves are occupying this place.”\n\nFang Yuan did not hesitate, he gave up on this place.\n\nHe took a detour past the wolf group’s territory, heading to the second destination."
