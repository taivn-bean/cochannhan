The falling star hound moved back by a huge step, its head was spinning.\n\nIt shook his head, clearing its mind.\n\nDuring this period of time, five or six killer moves shot out from the giant grass, impacting on the falling star hound’s body.\n\nThe falling star hound cried out in pain, its flesh was cut open from the attacks.\n\nFang Yuan watched coldly from the side.\n\n“It seems that not just Twelfth Hair, the other hairy man Gu Immortals have also learned to use their immortal killer moves.”\n\n“But these immortal killer moves mostly only have one core Immortal Gu, they are at rank six level.”\n\nAfter the falling star hound was attacked for a long time, even though its flesh was torn open, it was only lightly injured.\n\nIt was an ancient desolate beast, even as an infant which had not reached maturity, it still had incredible defense and recovery abilities.\n\n“I cannot fail this time, Fang Yuan will see me as a joke!” Twelfth Hair concentrated, he was filled with unprecedented determination.\n\nThe three desolate beasts seemed to be able to sense their master’s feelings, they were filled with battle intent.\n\nUnder Twelfth Hair’s manipulation, the diamond bear with the sturdiest body resisted attacks, while the golden-white tiger assisted it. As for the chestnut yak, even though it was very weak, it could cause some interferences on the side.\n\n“Twelfth Hair is directing the desolate beasts, he seems to be having an easy time. But this situation is quite stagnant, the falling star hound is attacking fiercely, he has not sent out a fourth desolate beast yet. I am afraid he only has three desolate beasts after all.”\n\nFang Yuan calmly analyzed.\n\nHe even had to use a desolate beast like the chestnut yak, Fang Yuan’s guess was very likely to be true.\n\n“After treasure yellow heaven opened, Twelfth Hair bought a diamond bear and a golden-white tiger. But his choice is quite questionable, the diamond bear itself is sufficient. Golden-white tiger is a metal path desolate beast with strong defenses as well, he might as well get a flying desolate beast, it would pose a greater threat. That way, the falling star hound would be distracted more and act more warily, it would have weaker attacks when trying to defend itself. Hmm?”\n\nFang Yuan was thinking about this, when Twelfth Hair made a mistake, the diamond bear left a gap open after moving away.\n\n“Damn it!” Twelfth Hair stared with furious eyes, he immediately moved the chestnut yak to fill the gap.\n\n“You have to hang on!” Twelfth Hair bellowed in his mind.\n\nThe falling star hound growled, slamming the chestnut yak away.\n\nNext, the falling star hound broke away from the encirclement and charged into the grass.\n\nAs a result, the hairy man Gu Immortals hiding in the grass screamed in terror.\n\n“Quick, use that move!” Seeing that he was about to be hit by the falling star hound, an unlucky hairy man Gu Immortal shouted in fear.\n\nSwoosh.\n\nAt the next moment, he vanished on the spot, appearing beside another hairy man a thousand steps away from him.\n\n“Thanks, thanks. You acted quickly, otherwise, I would have died.” The hairy man Gu Immortal who was saved still felt lingering fear.\n\nThe one who saved him was Sixth Hair.\n\nHe patted the hairy man Gu Immortal’s shoulder: “Relax, relax, don’t forget the outsider is here, don’t make our Lang Ya Sect lose face.”\n\nEven now, he was still trying to sow discord.\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortal who was saved quickly concealed his expression, but his body was still shaking slightly.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly, killing intent was hidden in his gaze as he looked at Sixth Hair.\n\n“I will slaughter this fellow one day! But we are members of Lang Ya Sect now, the information path alliance agreement prevents us from killing each other. So to kill him, I need to get rid of this Lang Ya Sect alliance agreement secretly first.”\n\nFang Yuan wanted to make use of Lang Ya Sect’s strength, Sixth Hair was a severe obstacle.\n\nSixth Hair played a big role in causing Fang Yuan and Lang Ya Sect’s relationship to turn so sour.\n\nIn Lang Ya Sect, Fang Yuan and Sixth Hair both had ulterior motives. Their relationship was not simple either.\n\nBecause they had made transactions, they had a hold on each other.\n\nFang Yuan had Lang Ya Sect’s alliance agreement, he could not do things that harmed Lang Ya Sect. Of course, he could think and talk about them. Sixth Hair was a member of Lang Ya Sect, because of this, if Sixth Hair was in fatal danger, Fang Yuan had to save him! Of course, it depended on the situation. If Sixth Hair tried to suicidally put himself in danger and lure an ancient desolate beast in order to entrap Fang Yuan, he would not have to save him in that situation.\n\nSince Fang Yuan joined Lang Ya Sect and went under an alliance agreement, he was not going to be restricted so easily.\n\nAnd Sixth Hair only wanted to get rid of Fang Yuan and obtain his body. He had insufficient strength, and Fang Yuan had a hold on him, because of Shadow Sect’s plan, he was the final spy left in Lang Ya blessed land, he had to stay hidden.\n\nBoth sides had their own reservations, they were wary of each other.\n\nAs if he had sensed Fang Yuan’s gaze, Sixth Hair turned around and smiled sinisterly.\n\nHe was a split soul of Spectral Soul, he had rich battle experience. This was why he could save the hairy man Gu Immortal before anyone else reacted.\n\nHe was trying to unite the hairy man Gu Immortals and ostracize Fang Yuan, limiting his growth.\n\nThe battle continued.\n\nThe falling star hound did not kill the hairy man Gu Immortal, the diamond bear and golden-white tiger quickly diverted it. Soon, the chestnut yak arrived as well, forming an encirclement again.\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortals also continued their long range attacks.\n\nBut Twelfth Hair continued to make flaws in the battle due to unexpected circumstances, even though he was performing above his usual abilities.\n\nAfter getting out of the encirclement, the falling star hound attempted to kill the other hairy man Gu Immortals.\n\nBut these hairy man Gu Immortals seemed to have the same immortal killer move. Whenever one was targeted, the rest would be able to teleport them away to another comrade’s side.\n\n“This immortal killer move is quite interesting.” Fang Yuan watched silently, he subconsciously placed himself in the falling star hound’s position, what would he do to resolve the killer move?\n\nSoon, Fang Yuan had an answer.\n\nIt was difficult to resolve this killer move. Because with just this little bit of information, he could not analyze anything.\n\nHe did not even know the name of the killer move.\n\nIn this short period of time, the killer move did not seem to have any flaws.\n\n“Even if I cannot break it, it is very easy to kill these hairy man Gu Immortals. My movement speed far exceeds them, sword marks targeting death and dark assassination can cause many deaths to them already. In fact, just flying sword Immortal Gu alone can kill them. Of course, Sixth Hair is hiding his strength, that is another issue. The actual situation would depend on how the fight develops.”\n\n“I am about to succeed! This time, I will truly defeat the falling star hound!” Twelfth Hair got more and more excited, the light of victory could be seen in his eyes.\n\nThis time, he performed better than usual, seven to eight hairy man Gu Immortals along with three desolate beasts were fighting against an infant falling star hound. With the proper tactics, victory was favoring these hairy man Gu Immortals.\n\n“Fang Yuan, are you seeing this? Even without you, we can take down the falling star hound and obtain true victory!” Twelfth Hair cried out in his mind.\n\nHe loved his home, he was extremely loyal to Lang Ya Sect. Earlier, when Lang Ya Sect was facing trouble with developing in Tai Qiu, Fang Yuan watched on the side, Twelfth Hair had a lot of grudge towards Fang Yuan.\n\nWhen he was injured and bedridden, Fang Yuan went to visit him, but he did not even want to meet, he sent a mortal Gu Master to reject Fang Yuan’s entry into the cloud city.\n\nThis victory had incredible meaning for him.\n\nBeing able to obtain victory in front of Fang Yuan, Twelfth Hair felt great pride and joy!\n\nAs time passed, the battle situation was becoming obvious.\n\nFalling star hound was gradually unable to hold on, the hairy man Gu Immortals felt that their pressure was lifting.\n\nThey unavoidably became excited, some of them could even see victory ahead, their eyes were red from excitement, they were trembling slightly.\n\nIt was not easy!\n\nWith their horrible battle strength, fighting against the falling star hound resulted in repeated setbacks.\n\nThey had put in so much blood and sweat, coming up with a tactic to deal with the falling star hound, they had spent countless sleepless nights practising, they were finally going to succeed today!\n\nEven though they were tired and their immortal essence was depleted, the hairy man Gu Immortals felt revitalized, they were having an adrenaline rush.\n\n“Kill, kill this dog!”\n\n“That’s right, tear its skin and hang it above the cloud cities, let everyone see our victory!”\n\n“Hahaha, we finally defeated it.”\n\n“Fang Yuan, are you seeing this? I know you are unwilling, but so what?”\n\n“Today, we will teach you a lesson, the hairy man Gu Immortals are not powerless. Lang Ya Sect belongs to us hairy men, it is not for a human like you!”\n\nThe hairy man Gu Immortals shouted and screamed in excitement.\n\nFang Yuan smiled plainly, as if he did not hear them.\n\nHis attitude made the hairy man Gu Immortals disappointed, some of them even felt disgust and anger.\n\n“He is just concealing his emotions, what can he do?” A hairy man Gu Immortal sneered.\n\nHowever, a change occurred right at this moment!\n\nAn eagle hound suddenly appeared in the center of the battlefield, with one swipe of its claws, the diamond bear fell! With one peck from its beak, chestnut yak went blind! With a flap of its wings, intense winds blew, the golden-white tiger flew back by dozens of steps. The falling star hound curled up into a ball, whimpering in fear.\n\n“What, where did this ancient desolate beast come from?” The hairy man Gu Immortals were shocked.\n\n“Not, not just one!” Soon, five eagle hounds appeared from the grass, and three were flying in the sky.\n\nOut of nowhere, eagle hounds had completely encircled the hairy man Gu Immortals.\n\n“How, how did this happen?” Twelfth Hair’s pupils shrunk to pin size, he was completely stunned!\n\nHe had just experienced going from heaven to hell.\n\nA moment ago, he was still a high and mighty victor, at the next moment, his life was on the line, this was a desperate situation!\n\n“Oh? Heaven’s will, this is your ambush huh… incredible indeed.” Fang Yuan laughed in his mind.\n\nThe eagle hounds did not make a noise, while the hairy man Gu Immortals were shocked beyond words, there was silence.\n\n“Oh Twelfth Hair, it seems that you have all failed. According to our earlier agreement, it is time for me to act.” Amidst the silence, Fang Yuan’s plain words could be heard.\n\nFor some reason, Twelfth Hair felt his heart jump, intense rage was burning inside him, he screamed at Fang Yuan: “You, are you making a mistake! What are you talking about? Open your damned eyes and see the situation we are in, okay?!”\n\nFang Yuan’s lips curled slightly.\n\nBam!!\n\nA strength path giant hand appeared out of nowhere, it slammed the eagle hound closest to Fang Yuan to the ground.\n\nDust and smoke rose.\n\nThe eagle hounds’ attention was drawn away, towards Fang Yuan, they were wary of this strong enemy.\n\nWithin the dust cloud, Fang Yuan’s voice could be heard: “Alright, I will accept this present, can everyone please go far away, don’t be a disturbance to me.”"
