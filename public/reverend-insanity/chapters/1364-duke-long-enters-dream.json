Even though the latter actually had peak rank eight battle strength!\n\n“Lord Purple’s strength will continue to weaken, because he is constantly using the immortal killer move to create more defective Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies and clear the dream realm. During this process, he would need to split his own soul, it is extremely painful!”\n\nYing Wu Xie watched with worry.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was not Duke Long’s match to begin with, but he still had to create Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique bodies now. By the time Purple Mountain True Monarch’s methods were fully understood by Duke Long, he would lose.\n\n“Quick, quick, quick!” Ying Wu Xie urged himself.\n\nHe would not tell this to Fang Yuan of course.\n\nEven though they were working together, they did not set any information path agreements, Ying Wu Xie did not trust Fang Yuan fully.\n\nBut if they wanted to set an agreement, the situation did not allow them to, and even if they could, Fang Yuan would not do it.\n\nBoth sides wanted to cooperate, but they did not trust each other. But because of the enemy, Heavenly Court, they had to work together!\n\n“Found it, towards your southeast, there is a cocoon of light about to form, get there quickly.” At this time, Fang Yuan transmitted.\n\nYing Wu Xie looked in that direction and felt hesitant.\n\nIf he followed Fang Yuan’s instructions, he had to get deep into the territory of Southern Border’s righteous path. There were many Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals there.\n\nWas Fang Yuan reliable? Was this a trap?\n\nYing Wu Xie could not help but hesitate.\n\n“If I wanted to harm you, you would have died earlier.” Fang Yuan transmitted, as if he knew what Ying Wu Xie was thinking.\n\nYing Wu Xie had to admit that Fang Yuan was right, but he thought: “Maybe Fang Yuan doesn’t want me dead, and wants to capture me alive? If he wants to capture me, he would need to make arrangements, is there a Gu formation or a battlefield killer move there?”\n\nBut this time, Ying Wu Xie shook his head, no longer hesitating.\n\nHe wanted to gamble.\n\nAt this moment, he had to gamble!\n\nFollowing Fang Yuan’s instructions, he flew.\n\nSoon, he saw a Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortal.\n\n“Damn it!” Ying Wu Xie’s heart jumped.\n\nThe Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortal also found him.\n\nBut when he was about to pounce on Ying Wu Xie, his face changed, after hesitating, he flew away with a complex expression.\n\n“Why did that happen?!” Ying Wu Xie was shocked.\n\nThis was the second time.\n\nWas he also Fang Yuan’s subordinate?\n\nIf so, why did he had that expression, he strangely looked unwilling and slightly angry?\n\nYing Wu Xie was getting more confused.\n\nHe continued to move forward and met with the third person, and then a fourth. The two Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals he met also left him alone.\n\nThis was naturally Fang Yuan’s manipulation.\n\nUsing the excuse of the big picture, he sent all those Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals away with simple reasons.\n\nFor example, ‘that place needs you more’, ‘an ally is in danger, if you do not go, they will die’, and ‘ignore that rank six immortal zombie, I have sent others to deal with him ahead’…\n\nAll sorts of reasons allowed Ying Wu Xie to move unhindered.\n\nNobody would expect Wu Yi Hai to work with Shadow Sect.\n\nAmong the righteous path Gu Immortals in Southern Border, who would think of that?\n\nAt this time, Heavenly Court had not yet exposed Fang Yuan’s true identity.\n\nWith Fang Yuan’s help, Ying Wu Xie got closer to his destination.\n\n“Hmm? There is actually a cocoon of light here?” Rank seven expert Yi Hei Ting had a sudden discovery.\n\nHis body flickered with lightning, bringing his body towards the cocoon.\n\n“Stop it!” Ying Wu Xie who had just arrived suddenly shouted out loud.\n\nYi Hei Ting felt strange: “Who is this? He actually made it here!”\n\nYing Wu Xie’s yell did not disrupt him, he was already very close to the light cocoon, he was about to succeed.\n\nBut at the next moment, Yi Hei Ting’s vision changed.\n\nHe was forcefully teleported by the super Gu formation.\n\n“Lord Wu Yi Hai! I was about to…” Yi Hei Ting realized this and suddenly bellowed.\n\nHe was truly a hindrance rather than help! He was clearly about to succeed!\n\n“I know, but another place needs you more. Don’t worry, I have already noticed the enemy by the cocoon, I will deal with it.” Fang Yuan interrupted Yi Hei Ting’s words.\n\nYi Hei Ting wanted to say more, but his vision changed, he was teleported out again to another place.\n\n“This Wu Yi Hai, he thinks he can use me as a pawn because he controls the Gu formation? Hmph!” Yi Hei Ting was extremely unhappy, but he did not suspect Fang Yuan’s true intentions.\n\nFang Yuan did not randomly teleport him, because around him, there was a Southern Border Gu Immortal about to die from Fairy Miao Yin.\n\nYi Hei Ting quickly entered the battle, forgetting about the displeasure towards Fang Yuan.\n\nYing Wu Xie felt like he was in a dream!\n\nSeeing that Yi Hei Ting was about to succeed, he almost despaired.\n\nBut at the next moment, he went from hell to heaven, this change was too sudden, he was overjoyed.\n\nYing Wu Xie was a little dazed.\n\nBut when he came to his senses, he contacted Fang Yuan with his information path Gu worm, crying out: “You, you actually control the entire super Gu formation! What is your current identity?”\n\nFang Yuan knew this could not be concealed, he exposed it: “Who else? I am currently Wu Yi Hai.”\n\nYing Wu Xie heard this, his eyes almost popped out.\n\nThis answer was too stunning, since when and what methods did Fang Yuan use to get to this position?\n\nAfter accepting this fact, Ying Wu Xie understood everything.\n\nNo wonder those Southern Border righteous path Gu Immortals gave way to him, Ying Wu Xie thought that their expressions were rather funny now.\n\nBut soon, he felt some worry.\n\n“Fang Yuan has unravel dream, staying here for so long without any detection, he definitely has a huge scheme! He definitely made great gains!”\n\n“So close. If not for Lord Purple’s plan to catch the righteous path off guard, Fang Yuan might have been able to continue staying here for a long time, it would be a huge problem for Shadow Sect.”\n\nYing Wu Xie’s emotions were changing, from shock to realization and to worry, he finally reached the cocoon of light.\n\n“This aura! A rank seven cocoon.” Ying Wu Xie was excited.\n\n“How can I choose wrongly? What are you waiting for?” Fang Yuan laughed.\n\nYing Wu Xie nodded, using his immortal killer move.\n\nThis killer move took effect rapidly, in an instant, the cocoon that had not formed yet stabilized completely and took shape.\n\nYing Wu Xie’s soul and Gu worms entered the cocoon of light.\n\nMeanwhile, his rank six immortal zombie body was abandoned.\n\nThe cocoon of light broke apart as a rank seven Ying Wu Xie appeared!\n\n“Don’t resist, I will send you off.” Fang Yuan’s voice entered Ying Wu Xie’s mind again.\n\nAt the next moment, Ying Wu Xie was teleported away, watching Duke Long and Purple Mountain True Monarch’s battle again.\n\nWithout hesitation, Ying Wu Xie used his trump card.\n\nImmortal killer move — Lead Soul Into Dream!\n\n“Urgh!” Duke Long’s expression changed, in an instant, he was dragged into a dream.\n\nAt the next moment, he lost contact with the outside world.\n\nPurple Mountain True Monarch was stunned: “What is going on? A scheme?”\n\nBut next, he received Ying Wu Xie’s transmission: “I am here, Lord Purple, I am a rank seven dream path Gu Immortal now!”\n\n“Good.” Purple Mountain True Monarch was overjoyed, this trump card was finally activated.\n\n“After some hurdles, I obtained this immortal body due to Fang Yuan’s help. He is currently acting as Wu Yi Hai, he is controlling the super Gu formation of Southern Border’s righteous path, he wants to cooperate with you.”\n\n“Oh?!” Purple Mountain True Monarch’s eyes shined brightly: “Excellent, send my information path Gu worm to him, we need to talk.”\n\nWith Fang Yuan and Shadow Sect starting their cooperation, the situation finally appeared to be turning around!"
