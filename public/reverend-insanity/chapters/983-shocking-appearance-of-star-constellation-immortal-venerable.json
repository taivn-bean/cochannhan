But in the ten great ancient sects of Central Continent, where would they find a Gu Immortal who had cultivation level as low as Fang Yuan?\n\nThus, Fang Yuan became the sole and unique person in this category.\n\nImmortal Crane Sect made full use of the rules of this contest and allowed him to enter the grotto-heaven fragment world.\n\nLike in his previous life, Fairy Bai Qing asked Fang Yuan to take care of Feng Jin Huang.\n\nFang Yuan agreed, but he was thinking internally, should he kill Feng Jin Huang here?\n\nDue to Spirit Affinity House keeping it a secret and concealing Feng Jiu Ge’s death, according to Fang Yuan’s information, he knew that Feng Jiu Ge had gone missing in Northern Plains.\n\nBut thinking about it, Fang Yuan gave up on this idea.\n\n“Even though Feng Jiu Ge died in my previous life, at this point, the hundred days battle has not concluded yet, anything is possible. Furthermore, Feng Jiu Ge’s death was not confirmed in my previous life.”\n\n“Most importantly, I harmed Feng Jin Huang back then because I wanted her dream wings Immortal Gu. But even though she is a mortal, she can destroy the Immortal Gu with a thought. Even though I am a Gu Immortal, I do not have special methods to steal it. Dealing with her now is courting death, with Feng Jiu Ge still at the height of power, I will definitely face the attack of Spirit Affinity House and the other forces!”\n\n“Go in. The others have already entered, your cultivation is the highest so you are the last one.” He Feng Yang said heavily.\n\nThere was no other choice, if Fang Yuan entered first, the mortal Gu Masters from the other nine sects could not compete with Fang Yuan.\n\nOf course, this showed Immortal Crane Sect’s weakness as well.\n\nIf Immortal Crane Sect was as strong as Spirit Affinity House, it would not be difficult to arrange Fang Yuan as the first person to go in.\n\nThe fragment world of Starry Sky grotto-heaven was right in front of Fang Yuan.\n\nAn ocean-blue lake appeared like a half torn drawing, suddenly inserted into this mountain valley that was full of trees.\n\nThis was not a complete grotto-heaven or blessed land, Fang Yuan stepped in directly.\n\nAt the next moment, he was inside the Starry Sky grotto-heaven fragment world. Looking back, the Gu Immortals from the ten great ancient sects of Central Continent were still in the valley, they were no longer in the same world as Fang Yuan.\n\nThe gazes of these Gu Immortals were either solemn, envious, or jealous.\n\nThey could not help it, their cultivation level was too high, they had too many dao marks, if they entered outright, they would directly cause this weak fragment world to break apart.\n\n“This lake is huge, I remember that in my previous life, a desolate beast dragonfish was hidden near the small island at the center of the lake, it was influenced by someone’s Immortal Gu and became berserk and frenzied. I have lost self strength Immortal Gu and cannot use strength path giant hand. It will be harder for me to capture it now.”\n\nFang Yuan recalled as he flew out.\n\nSimilarly to his previous life, elite Gu Masters of Heaven’s Envy Manor were trapped on the small central island.\n\nAround the island, the lake water was treacherous, that desolate beast dragonfish was wreaking havoc, creating huge waves.\n\nFang Yuan descended from the sky, using immortal methods and expending some effort to capture the dragonfish.\n\nOther than the desolate beast dragonfish, there were over six hundred thousand ordinary dragonfish.\n\nLeaving behind the shocked and paralyzed Heaven’s Envy Manor Gu Masters, Fang Yuan flew towards the direction of the dream realm.\n\nArriving at the dream realm’s area, Feng Jin Huang had already led the four Gu Masters from Spirit Affinity House and occupied this dream realm.\n\n“Fang Yuan, I have been waiting for quite a while.” Feng Jin Huang smiled, her facial features were picturesque, her skin was fair and she radiated deep confidence.\n\nFang Yuan smiled too: “Before this trip, your mother asked me to take care of you. I will not find trouble with you, I will try to let you have an easy time, but there is a price for it. What can you give me?”\n\nFeng Jin Huang was prepared and was about to speak.\n\nFang Yuan interrupted her: “If you want to use a method to restore an immortal zombie back to human as the price, forget it. I have already found a suitable method, of course, it is not the ten extreme physique ascension method that you told me before.”\n\nFeng Jin Huang stared blankly, being caught off guard.\n\nShe did not expect Fang Yuan to find a suitable immortal zombie revival method so quickly.\n\n“How about this, I know that Spirit Affinity House’s research in dream realms far surpasses the other nine ancient sects. I only need the Gu recipe of a dream realm mortal Gu, I will let you stay at this dream realm and explore it for some time, how about that? You have dream wings Immortal Gu, don’t tell me you do not know the recipe of some dream realm mortal Gu.” Fang Yuan suggested.\n\nAccording to the ten sects’ agreement, for the representative of Spirit Affinity House, Feng Jin Huang, to occupy this place, she needed to face the challenge of any sect. Only with two out of three victories could she take away the opponent’s rights to claim this territory.\n\nEven though Feng Jin Huang had Fairy Bai Qing’s Immortal Gu, will, and immortal essence, she was still a mortal, she could not beat the immortal zombie Fang Yuan.\n\nFeng Jin Huang’s expression was bitter: “Fang Yuan, your request is too hard to meet. I have dream wings Immortal Gu, everyone knows that. But the value of a dream path mortal Gu recipe is immense, you may be severely underestimating it. I have used some dream path mortal Gu before, but they were only extremely secret practice. I planned to combine them with Dream Wings to create an immortal killer move, but I failed. Those mortal Gu were given to me by the sect, I do not know a single dream path mortal Gu recipe. Change your request, for example, a strength path mortal Gu recipe.”\n\nAt this time, dream realms had not appeared on a large scale, dream path was still being explored, it had not been created yet.\n\nEven though dream path Gu worms were appearing, they were limited in quantity.\n\nTo make dream path a mature path, it was not enough with just Dream Wings or Dream Travel.\n\nOnly a widely cultivated path can be known as a path.\n\nDream path was still developing in its infancy period. In the five regions, only super forces could research on it. Thus, the value of dream path mortal Gu recipes was immense.\n\nFang Yuan did not pester about this matter.\n\nHe knew: even if Feng Jin Huang knew any dream path mortal Gu recipes, she would not hand them to him.\n\nThus, this request was only to set up for his true motive.\n\nFang Yuan said: “Then in that case, I want information on Sword Immortal Bo Qing. You may not know, but this person is a legendary character from Spirit Affinity House. Hand his information to me, don’t try and deceive me with those details already in the market.”\n\nFeng Jin Huang thought: “This Fang Yuan underestimates me! Even though I am a mortal Gu Master, I have been in the Gu Immortal world since a young age. How would I not know Bo Qing? But, why is Fang Yuan seeking Bo Qing’s information?”\n\nShe thought again: “Bo Qing is already dead, what’s wrong with agreeing to it? It is easy for mother to get the information, even if it involves Spirit Affinity House’s secrets, I know my limits, I will not hand all of the confidential information to Fang Yuan.”\n\nAfter thinking about it, Feng Jin Huang agreed.\n\nBut Fang Yuan continued: “This dream realm is something Immortal Crane Sect must have. The duration of your exploration will depend on what information you give me. You can transmit to your mother to start preparing already. Two hours later, in Central Continent’s time, I want to see it. Then, according to the value of the information, I will decide your time in the dream realm.”\n\nFeng Jin Huang’s heart sank, she knew that Fang Yuan could not be fooled so easily.\n\nShe was the treasure of both her parents, she naturally had Immortal Gu with her, and large numbers of information path mortal Gu, Fairy Bai Qing could learn about Feng Jin Huang’s status at any time.\n\nAfter spending some effort, both sides finally came to an agreement.\n\nFang Yuan was very straightforward, he left the area near the dream realm immediately. This time, even though he had already subdued the desolate beast dragonfish, he still needed to take the desolate beast hidden essence turtle, and the desolate plant nether grass.\n\nTwo hours later in Central Continent time, a few days had gone by in the Starry Sky grotto-heaven fragment world.\n\nFang Yuan captured the hidden essence turtle and nether grass, and just like his previous life, he let out some rockmen to explore for him, searching for valuable Gu worms or materials.\n\nHe returned to the dream realm’s location as Feng Jin Huang handed him the first batch of information, while unable to conceal her dejected and irritated emotions.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the information as he nodded, it was very in-depth, as expected of Spirit Affinity House’s internal information.\n\n“In my previous life, the heavenly river in Central Continent had a huge disturbance and many Gu Immortals gained a lot of benefits, but I could not interfere. This time, with my experience, I will not need to make many deductions, I can save much time and effort, I might be able to explore Falling Heavenly River in time.”\n\nFang Yuan thought as he evaluated openly: “This information, although in-depth, does not talk much about secrets. According to our agreement, I will give you three days. Of course, that is in terms of the fragment world’s time.”\n\nFeng Jin Huang nodded, sighing internally.\n\nShe had overestimated herself, while underestimating the dream realm’s difficulty. Until now, even though she had dream wings Immortal Gu, she could not pass the first layer of the dream realm.\n\nShe had thought that six to seven days was enough to explore this dream realm completely and obtain great gains.\n\nBut the cruel reality was like a loud slap on her face.\n\n“If I knew this, I would lower the price during our agreement. Now, this information can only provide me three days… this is not enough to even heal my injuries. Sigh!”\n\nFeng Jin Huang sighed deeply again.\n\nFang Yuan knew about her status clearly, but he pretended to not know and left.\n\nBut secretly, he turned towards the other side of the dream realm and entered it stealthily.\n\nWith his previous life’s experience, he was very proficient, and with enough preparation, he had a large number of dream path mortal Gu, he could use the killer move unravel dream much more frequently.\n\nThe first layer’s beastmen wind knot grass dream realm, the second layer’s mountain peak astrolabe chessboard dream realm, they were all unraveled.\n\nHe finally came to the third layer of the dream realm.\n\nHe did not manage to come here in his previous life.\n\nThere was a shore with willows on it, the lake’s surface was like a mirror.\n\nIn the pavilion at the center of the lake, a female immortal was playing the zither.\n\n“You are finally here.” She looked at Fang Yuan, starlight shining brilliantly in her eyes, as her mouth was showing a mysterious smile.\n\nFang Yuan’s body shuddered.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable!"
