As for the otherworldly demon Zhao Lian Yun, she became the key person in this rescue mission, she was brought to Northern Plains.\n\nSeveral days later.\n\nNorthern Plains Zombie Alliance, Dark Flow Giant City.\n\nBoom!\n\nA loud sound was heard as intense explosions occurred, the entirety of Giant City trembled.\n\n“What is going on?”\n\n“What is going on? Is someone attacking Dark Flow Giant City?”\n\nIn Dark Flow Giant City, people had fallen to the ground, shocked cries were heard.\n\nDark Flow Giant City was enormous, it had a total of seven layers. The lower five layers were the residences of mortal Gu Masters and were very bustling and clamorous. One layer above was where people with some connection to immortal zombies resided. The highest layer was reserved for immortals only.\n\nAt this moment, at the highest layer of Dark Flow Giant City, a thick smoke rose into the sky.\n\n“Cough cough.” Fang Yuan was covered in soot as he came out of the secret room, he was coughing non-stop.\n\nHe failed again when refining star thought Immortal Gu.\n\nEver since they made the new alliance agreement, Fang Yuan did not return to his blessed land, he came to Dark Flow Giant City and used Northern Plains Zombie Alliance’s refinement path Gu formation.\n\nHe was not a refinement path Gu Immortal, he could not set up a refinement path Gu formation of such a level himself.\n\nFang Yuan tried to refine star thought Immortal Gu again.\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness had funded him a huge amount of immortal materials for Gu refinement in accordance with the agreement.\n\nThis time, the immortal materials were not tampered with at all.\n\nFang Yuan had an easy time during the refinement, but during the final few steps, the Gu refinement failed, and an intense explosion occurred.\n\nNot only was the entire refinement path Gu formation blown to bits, the explosion also destroyed the secret room, alerting all of the Gu Immortals in Dark Flow Giant City, even the mortals in the lower layers felt it.\n\n“At the final few steps, the dao marks will undergo a unique change that cannot be controlled. The interaction of dao marks would only stabilize under one condition, that is the successful refinement of star thought Immortal Gu. This step is purely dependent on luck.” Fang Yuan sighed internally.\n\nMan is the spirit of all beings, Gu are the essence of heaven and earth.\n\nAll living beings, including humans, could not directly manipulate dao marks. Be it Gu Masters, desolate beasts, desolate plants, even if they had dao marks in them, they could only make use of them through Gu worms.\n\nThus, when Gu Immortals refine Gu, they could not directly manipulate the dao marks, they could not control intense changes in the dao marks.\n\nTo make a rather crude comparison.\n\nRefining a rank six Immortal Gu was like playing golf.\n\nThe Gu Immortal’s preparations are all to ensure that the golf ball moves according to the path that they had planned.\n\nBut the long path that the ball needs to travel on is filled with over a hundred holes.\n\nOnly when the golf ball falls into the correct hole at the end of the path would the Gu refinement succeed.\n\nGu Immortals could only ensure that the golf ball would move according to their wishes during the first half of the route, by the second half, the ground would be uneven and filled with pits, the Gu Immortals would not be able to control how the ball moved anymore.\n\nThus, whether the ball could enter the proper hole depended on luck.\n\n“Even though Blazing Heaven Demoness no longer tampered with the immortal materials, her funding is not without cost, I need to pay her back eventually. Refining Immortal Gu is simply too hard, the success rate is too low. Maybe I can seek help from Lang Ya land spirit, he should have a strong refinement path Immortal Gu, or a special refinement method to increase the rate of successfully refining Immortal Gu.”\n\nIn history, Long Hair Ancestor was known as the ‘number one refinement path immortal of all times’, the number of Immortal Gu that he had refined in his life shocked countless people.\n\nEven though Long Hair Ancestor had died, his land spirit was alive, and Lang Ya blessed land was still intact.\n\nFang Yuan’s Gu refinement had failed again, he even suffered injuries.\n\nHe decided to seek help from Lang Ya land spirit and try to increase his chances, even if he had to pay a huge price!\n\n“I’d suggest you to first try refining the strength path Immortal Gu.” At this time, Fairy Li Shan came over and gave Fang Yuan a suggestion.\n\nFairy Li Shan could no longer stay in Snowy Mountain blessed land. Ever since they killed Hei Cheng, Fairy Li Shan had been staying inside Dark Flow Giant City.\n\nHer relationship with Blazing Heaven Demoness was exposed, everyone knew about it.\n\nEarlier, Blazing Heaven Demoness had led a band of immortal zombies to assault the Snowy Mountain blessed land demonic path Gu Immortals, with high rates of success.\n\nIn actual fact, it was because Fairy Li Shan was the traitor exposing intelligence to Blazing Heaven Demoness.\n\nFairy Li Shan was an information path quasi-great grandmaster, even though she had was restricted by the alliance agreement of the forces of Snowy Mountain blessed land, she could skirt around the restrictions and aid Blazing Heaven Demoness while only suffering mild injuries from violating it.\n\nHow could Old Ancestor Xue Hu keep such a traitor?\n\nAfter meeting with Blazing Heaven Demoness, he publicly announced the expulsion of Fairy Li Shan, and declared her to be an enemy of Snowy Mountain blessed land.\n\nFairy Li Shan had offended the biggest demonic path force in Northern Plains, but she was welcomed by Zombie Alliance. Her relationship with Blazing Heaven Demoness made her one of them. Furthermore, she was the key person in forcing Old Ancestor Xue Hu to give in just now, in Dark Flow Giant City, Fairy Li Shan was very well respected by the immortal zombies.\n\nFang Yuan heard Fairy Li Shan’s words and frowned: “Please explain.”\n\nFairy Li Shan sighed: “There is a change in the situation, my sister’s funding for your refinement of star thought Immortal Gu might have to be delayed.”\n\n“Why is that the case?” Fang Yuan could not understand, they had just set the agreement, was Blazing Heaven Demoness going to break the agreement so quickly?\n\nThat did not make sense.\n\nBecause funding Fang Yuan’s refinement of star thought Immortal Gu was Blazing Heaven Demoness’ idea.\n\nFairy Li Shan explained the reason and Fang Yuan soon understood why.\n\nThe reason was that the cooperation between Blazing Heaven Demoness and Old Ancestor Xue Hu had a huge impact on Northern Plains after Snowy Mountain and Zombie Alliance went into a ceasefire.\n\nThe conflict between both forces received much attention, some of the other regions even looked into the matter.\n\nBut Blazing Heaven Demoness and Old Ancestor Xue Hu knew their limits, they cooperated and settled this conflict rapidly and peacefully.\n\nThe righteous path forces in Northern Plains were excitedly watching this as they wanted to see a conflict between them.\n\nSuddenly, there was a turn of events.\n\nAs the conflict ended, Zombie Alliance’s headquarters sent out a mandatory mission in addition to the contribution points.\n\nAll the members of Northern Plains Zombie Alliance had to work together, using all their resources to refine a giant Gu formation.\n\nThis Gu formation’s sole use was to protect the immortal zombie graveyard.\n\nIf a situation like Old Ancestor Xue Hu stealing bodies happened again, the Gu formation would activate and defend the place. If it could not defend the place, the power of the Gu formation would teleport these immortal zombie bodies out of Northern Plains.\n\n“Right now, Zombie Alliance is putting in a huge sum! Not just the Northern Plains Zombie Alliance branch, but the other three branches and even the headquarters are building this giant Immortal Gu formation together. Just here alone, we are using thirteen Immortal Gu, and countless supplementary mortal Gu.”\n\n“Most of the Immortal Gu are sent here from the headquarters, but we also have to refine a number of them. Thus, Dark Flow Giant City is recalling all the immortal zombies back to refine Gu. There will definitely be insufficient storage in Dark Flow Giant City, the immortal zombies will have to use their personal resources.” Fairy Li Shan explained in detail.\n\nOf course, the immortal zombies would be compensated for contributing their personal resources.\n\nThe Zombie Alliance headquarters was giving out huge amounts of contribution points, much higher than ordinary times, to compensate the members.\n\nThis was among the biggest actions taken by Zombie Alliance in the last thousand years.\n\nAn immense amount of contribution points made the immortal zombie members feel enthusiastic about refining Gu. As long as they participated and expended immortal materials, regardless of whether they failed or succeeded, they would be able to obtain a huge sum of contribution points, this was a benefit rarely seen in a thousand years!\n\nFurthermore, after setting up this Gu formation, the Zombie Alliance graveyard would be safe without any future worries.\n\nThe immortal zombies in Zombie Alliance were also delighted to see the creation of this giant Immortal Gu formation.\n\nThe immortal zombies from Eastern Sea were temporarily unable to return to Eastern Sea, they stayed and refined Immortal Gu, and a huge number of supplementary mortal Gu.\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness was in the same place, she could no longer fund Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan’s plan to refine star thought Immortal Gu was obstructed, he could not even continue using the Gu refinement secret room.\n\nHe had already rescinded the Zombie Alliance agreement that had been placed on him.\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness, who was the branch leader, had the authority to do this.\n\nIn Dark Flow Giant City, Fang Yuan and Fairy Li Shan were both outsiders. Except that Fairy Li Shan was much more popular and well regarded than Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan frowned as he thought: “In the five hundred years of my previous life, Zombie Alliance had this plan too, and they even succeeded. But the reason was not because Old Ancestor Xue Hu stole immortal zombies from the graveyard. It seems that the course of history will not alter easily, in this life, Zombie Alliance is building this giant Immortal Gu formation again.”\n\nFang Yuan could not stop them, of course.\n\nZombie Alliance was a huge force, Blazing Heaven Demoness, who was just the leader of a branch, was already able to suppress him firmly.\n\nIf not for Fang Yuan’s immense value which interested Blazing Heaven Demoness, choosing to cooperate with him, Fang Yuan might have been dead already.\n\nBut no matter how strong Blazing Heaven Demoness was, Fang Yuan would not let go of the compensation that he was entitled to.\n\n“Blazing Heaven Demoness’ action is going against our alliance agreement, right?” Fang Yuan asked as he looked at Fairy Li Shan.\n\nFairy Li Shan smiled bitterly.\n\nThis was indeed Blazing Heaven Demoness violating the agreement.\n\nAccording to their alliance agreement, Blazing Heaven Demoness had to give Fang Yuan quite a sum of compensation.\n\nUnless Fang Yuan was willing to forgo the compensation claim, Blazing Heaven Demoness would have to pay him, otherwise the backlash of the agreement would heavily injure her.\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness was feeling regret towards this as well.\n\nIf she had known this, why would she fund Fang Yuan? Wasn’t a different condition better? Even if she wanted to fund him, she could do so in a different way that did not break the agreement.\n\nThe plan of Zombie Alliance caught Blazing Heaven Demoness off guard, since Fang Yuan refused to let go, she could only compensate him."
