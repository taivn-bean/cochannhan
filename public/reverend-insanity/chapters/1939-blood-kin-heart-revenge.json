He seems to have a transformation path method to turn all of his dao marks into the same path. Not only did he advance to rank eight, his dao marks are at an absurd number. How did he do it?”\n\n“Rather than thinking about this, you should think about how we can resolve this crisis now!” Qin Ding Ling urged.\n\nFairy Zi Wei was silent for a while before analyzing as she pointed at the silhouette: “Lord Duke Long’s strength is not inferior to Fang Yuan, it is just that he is too passive now as a result of protecting the immortal graveyard. This gives Fang Yuan the initiative, Lord Duke Long has to endure every offensive killer move he uses to make sure the immortal graveyard is intact.”\n\nFang Yuan could casually dodge Duke Long’s attacks but Duke Long had to block Fang Yuan’s attacks. This was too great of an advantage.\n\nIf one analyzed this, they would see that Duke Long and Fang Yuan were quite similar in power level. But Fang Yuan’s tactic was too wise, Duke Long would not be overly concerned if he attacked Heaven Overseeing Tower with high defense, but the immortal graveyard was different.\n\nThe primordial qi wall was destroyed by Fang Yuan, that was truly a huge move, it was crucial. It caused Duke Long to be taxed with defending against Fang Yuan’s attacks now.\n\nStar Constellation’s will could have awakened more Gu Immortals from the immortal graveyard, but Limitless Demon Venerable was stopping her at the moment.\n\nHow could they resolve this issue?\n\nFairy Zi Wei started to think about this deeply but she felt a strong headache, the intense pain made her body shake as she almost fainted again.\n\n“Be careful, your injuries are still quite severe!” Qin Ding Ling called out in concern.\n\nFairy Zi Wei nodded, frowning and enduring the headache, she spoke with difficulty: “The immortal graveyard is the biggest foundation and accumulation of Heavenly Court, we cannot lose it! We need to get rid of the problem which is Fang Yuan now, go and reinforce Senior Duke Long, get Gu Yue Fang Zheng to fight as well. He has been cultivating in the Demon Judgment Board recently, he progressed quite a bit. If you enter the Demon Judgment Board and coordinate with him, there will be good results.”\n\n“What about you?” Qin Ding Ling looked at Fairy Zi Wei with worry.\n\nFairy Zi Wei spat out a mouthful of blood: “I need to heal my injuries. Thankfully, there is a healing hall that can help me greatly. Don’t worry, this Immortal Gu House is at the periphery of the battlefield, it will not attract attention.”\n\n“Okay, be careful!” Qin Ding Ling hesitated for a moment before gritting her teeth and flying away.\n\nFairy Zi Wei felt her vision turning dark, after taking several huge breaths for a while, she stabilized her injuries and decided to move towards the healing hall.\n\nImmortal killer move — Summer Fan!\n\nWhoosh! Intense winds blew, sweeping everything in their path, rampaging through heaven and earth.\n\nDuke Long grunted as he flew back by three hundred steps, countless purple-gold scale fragments were scattered along the way.\n\nThe storm also engulfed Cang Xuan Zi, the female immortal cried out in pain as her vines snapped, she used her defensive killer moves with much difficulty to resist the attack.\n\nHer space path defensive killer move was quite amazing. Any move that landed on her would have to travel through a huge distance to reach her.\n\nBut no matter how long the distance was, the time path tornado still went into the immortal graveyard. Even though it only suffered a minor loss, still far from total destruction, Heavenly Court’s immortals still felt deeply pained when they saw that.\n\nFang Yuan snorted coldly, looking at Cang Xuan Zi coldly.\n\nHe was not happy with the current situation.\n\nCang Xuan Zi… he did not expect her to participate, Fang Yuan knew nothing about her. Especially when she cultivated space path, Fang Yuan’s attainment level in this path was too low.\n\nWithout enough space path attainment level, even though Fang Yuan had wisdom path attainment level, he could not deduce anything useful.\n\n“The bigger threat between them is Duke Long.” Standing on Myriad Year Flying Warship, Fang Yuan looked at Duke Long again.\n\nNot long ago, when Fang Yuan used summer fan, Duke Long flew back by five hundred steps, but now, it was only three hundred steps.\n\nSummer fan was an old killer move, even though Fang Yuan modified it, it had already been used before. At this point, Duke Long was getting used to dealing with it.\n\nOf course, the bigger reason was that Duke Long was continuously getting stronger!\n\n“Heavenly dragon’s last stand…” Fang Yuan muttered, he could feel what the Northern Plains immortals felt in the previous life when they fought Duke Long.\n\nDuke Long was strong to begin with, and more terrifyingly, he was continuously getting stronger.\n\nFang Yuan knew that even though he had the upper hand now, it was because of his wise tactic of targeting the enemy’s weakness! Duke Long was forced to defend it.\n\nIn terms of real battle, if he fought Duke Long and Cang Xuan Zi, they would be evenly matched.\n\nFang Yuan had Myriad Year Flying Warship, he coordinated well with it. This was the first time Duke Long was fighting with Cang Xuan Zi, and even though Cang Xuan Zi had deep foundation on par with Di Zang Sheng, she was unfamiliar with fighting techniques, it showed that under normal times she faced combat rarely.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan could also sense that she was getting more proficient in her methods as the fight went on.\n\nAfter all, a battle of life and death was the greatest form of training.\n\n“Time is pressing, if I cannot succeed soon, I will need to give up on this target.” Fang Yuan took a look at Heaven Overseeing Tower, once Genesis Lotus’ method was activated, he would attack that place.\n\nBefore that, he should destroy the immortal graveyard first. After all, nobody knew which monster would emerge from it next! After all, including Duke Long, Heavenly Court should have a total of four Dao Guardians.\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined with bright light, countless thoughts moved in his mind at rapid speed, countless battle tactics were being created.\n\nAt this point in time, he still had many trump card killer moves left. There was time cutting edge, unlimited qi sea, five finger fist heart sword, lead soul into dream, and other killer moves.\n\nIf he faced other enemies, these methods would decide the battle and kill them. But Duke Long and Cang Xuan Zi were not simple characters, against them, if his move failed, they would be prepared against the attack, Fang Yuan would not be able to use them effectively anymore.\n\nKill Duke Long and Cang Xuan Zi? It was not impossible for Fang Yuan!\n\nBut at the same time, Duke Long still had the killer move triple qi retraction, it was very threatening. If Fang Yuan got hit by it, the consequences would be severe. Fang Yuan was similarly wary of it.\n\nFurthermore, other than triple qi retraction, did Duke Long have other methods of similar strength?\n\nFang Yuan was not sure.\n\nAt the same time, Cang Xuan Zi was quite an unknown factor, she had lived much longer than Duke Long and also had a complex relationship with Genesis Lotus, who knew what methods she could bring out, it would not be surprising.\n\nFang Yuan continued to attack, he aimed attacks at the immortal graveyard while looking for an opportunity.\n\nDuke Long and Cang Xuan Zi were experienced monsters, their battle experience was incredibly vast.\n\nFang Yuan tried for a long time but he could not create any opportunities.\n\nAmidst the intense battle, a cloud of blood suddenly appeared.\n\nThe cloud of blood approached Fang Yuan, it had a peculiar aura.\n\nFang Yuan stepped softly as Myriad Year Flying Warship shook, a group of daybreak flying swords flew out and attacked the cloud.\n\nThe blood cloud was pierced by Fang Yuan, it was easily torn to shreds and vanished, but Fang Yuan’s expression changed.\n\nAt the next moment, Cooking Luck Pot appeared above him, blood markings appeared and stuck themselves onto Cooking Luck Pot, attempting to corrode Fang Yuan’s luck.\n\n“Blood path killer move?” Fang Yuan’s heart shook, his attacks slowed down as he split his attention to mobilize Cooking Luck Pot.\n\nBut no matter how he tried to cook his luck, he could not get rid of the blood markings. To get rid of them, Fang Yuan would need to concentrate fully, it would expend a lot of his time.\n\nFang Yuan cast his gaze far away as an Immortal Gu House approached him.\n\nThis was a red tombstone with countless words moving on it, it was the rank eight Immortal Gu House — Demon Judgment Board!\n\n“Fang Zheng… is that you?” Although lacking a clear reason, Fang Yuan guessed the identity of the person inside the Demon Judgment Board.\n\nWithin Demon Judgment Board, there was Gu Yue Fang Zheng and also Qin Ding Ling.\n\n“Fang Yuan was hit!” Fang Zheng was surprised and joyful: “Thank you for amplifying the power of my killer move.”\n\nAt this moment, behind Fang Zheng, Qin Ding Ling was placing both palms on his back as she helped him with her full strength.\n\nSeeing that this move had effect, Qin Ding Ling was surprised too, she looked at Gu Yue Fang Zheng in a new light.\n\nFang Zheng only had rank seven cultivation level but like what Fairy Zi Wei predicted, the killer moves he created were very effective on Fang Yuan.\n\n“Worthy of Fang Yuan’s nemesis, the pawn left behind specially by heaven’s will.” Qin Ding Ling sighed to herself.\n\nHeaven’s will attempted to destroy Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s plan, using Fang Yuan as the pawn. But Fang Yuan as an otherworldly demon was the greatest variable himself, thus heaven’s will arranged for Fang Zheng as well, to become the counter to Fang Yuan.\n\nThus, after Fang Zheng became the Demon Judgment Board Lord, he used the experience of the previous generations of Board Lords to create his own killer move, blood-kin heart revenge.\n\nThis blood path mimicked luck path, it also contained the profundity of human path. Qin Ding Ling’s amplification was only icing on the cake.\n\nBlood-kin heart revenge activated again!\n\nThe blood cloud approached while Fang Yuan dodged it.\n\nBut the blood cloud followed him closely, it did not stop chasing after him.\n\n“I’ve already used sovereign immortal fetus Gu, this body has no bloodline relationship with him, why is the blood cloud still approaching me?” At once, Fang Yuan’s gaze flickered with uncertainty."
