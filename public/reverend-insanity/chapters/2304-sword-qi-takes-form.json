  "content": "Chapter 2304: Sword Qi Takes Form\n\nImmortal battlefield killer move — Rumor Cage!\n\nZhou Xiong Xin clapped; in an instant, countless silver text characters emerged and circled Lin clan’s public blessed land.\n\nThese characters were large as horse carriages or small as ants, they weaved together into a huge ball, enveloping Heavenly Court five great Gu Immortals and Lin clan’s first supreme elder.\n\n“Success.” Zhou Xiong Xin said with excitement, letting out a breath of relief.\n\nA good start was half the success!\n\nThe other four Heavenly Court immortals also looked relieved.\n\nWhat they were most worried about was Lin clan’s first supreme elder running away.\n\nThey were all rank eight Gu Immortals, Heavenly Court was fighting five versus one, but it was very hard to catch a rank eight Gu Immortal who wanted to flee.\n\nWith the conflict between dao marks, Gu Immortals could not easily show the advantage of numbers. These five Heavenly Court immortals separately cultivated wood path, information path, fire path, blood path, and transformation path which conflicted with each other.\n\n“Rumor cage really deserves the title of the battlefield killer move with the fastest activation time.”\n\n“But I did not expect Lin clan’s first supreme elder to not dodge or flee.”\n\n“Did he see through it?”\n\nThe five Heavenly Court immortals conversed with each other through mental transmission.\n\nThey appeared grandly because they had already arranged a temporary formation outside Lin clan’s public blessed land headquarters.\n\nOnce Lin clan’s first supreme elder escaped or flew out of the public blessed land, the formation would be triggered and attack him, reducing his speed.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable had personally instructed them regarding the requirement of a sword immortal’s immortal aperture and body. These five Heavenly Court members naturally made ample preparations.\n\nAlthough this formation did not have much offensive power, it was modified by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable herself to target Lin clan’s first supreme elder’s escape methods.\n\nMoreover, public blessed lands always had weaker defense than an individual’s blessed land.\n\nAs an information path expert, Zhou Xiong Xin had already gathered relevant information when he moved around in Western Desert.\n\nLin clan’s first supreme elder was already trapped in rumor cage battlefield!\n\nPrince Feng Xian gave a shout and charged forward.\n\nHe flew to the sky and opened his mouth towards the palace.\n\nWhoosh—!\n\nFlames gushed out of his mouth and landed on the ground, growing rapidly into a blazing inferno.\n\nThe palace was only a mortal Gu House, it crumbled apart rapidly in the inferno.\n\nLin clan’s first supreme elder was forced to come out of his seclusion, he flew to the sky and faced the enemies.\n\nPrince Feng Xian, however, retreated slowly.\n\n“Lin clan’s first supreme elder, Lin Jian Xing, have a taste of my attack!” Wan Zi Hong chuckled charmingly as she took the place of Prince Feng Xian.\n\nShe activated a wood path killer move. Instantly, flower petals fluttered and covered the battlefield, a fragrant smell spreading along with it.\n\nAll the five Heavenly Court immortals held their breath.\n\nLin Jian Xing had a solemn expression as he pushed forward with his hands. In an instant, sword qi rampaged and formed into a giant wave.\n\nThe wave surged and billowed, washing away the poisonous flower petals.\n\nWan Zi Hong disappeared amidst the petals and appeared behind Lin Jian Xing.\n\nShe raised her left little finger that had a sharp purplish nail as she stabbed at Lin Jian Xing.\n\nImmortal killer move — Flower Thorn Stab.\n\nLin Jian Xing was struck, his figure paused before sword qi rose violently, sealing Wan Zi Hong within!\n\nAt the next moment, his previously activated sword qi wave moved backwards.\n\nThe surging giant wave drowned Lin Jian Xing and Wan Zi Hong.\n\nThe other four Heavenly Court immortals did not do anything to avoid hurting Wan Zi Hong.\n\nThe sword qi wave disappeared shortly afterwards, leaving only Lin Jian Xing while Wan Zi Hong disappeared once again.\n\nFlower petals fluttered beside Prince Feng Xian, turning into Wan Zi Hong.\n\nWan Zi Hong was injured but had a satisfied smile on her face: ”Stall him, he is struck by my method. The longer time goes by, the more thorns will grow in his body, hindering his movement and even stabbing him to death.”\n\nWan Zi Hong made her contribution, she retreated and began to heal her wounds.\n\nThe other Heavenly Court immortals continued to surround Lin Jian Xing, not giving him any time to rest.\n\nHeavenly Court made full use of their numerical advantage.\n\nThe silver characters that formed rumor cage began to let out dazzling light. The dense light flowed like water, moving in the air as it gathered and swirled. Next, from the silvery light, silver tigers emerged.\n\nThe tigers roared and pounced on Lin Jian Xing.\n\nIt was Zhou Xiong Xin’s killer move — Rumors Become Tigers.\n\nPrince Feng Xian made his move next; countless beautiful fire birds appeared out of thin air.\n\nThe fire birds burned intensely while having deep intelligence. They formed into groups and followed the tigers.\n\nRed Heart Traveler also made his move.\n\nBlood light pillars crashed down.\n\nTigers, fire birds, and blood pillars formed three waves of continuous attacks!\n\nLin Jian Xing was surrounded by the attacks but he did not evade.\n\nAgainst the incoming attacks, he shouted grandly as sword qi surged out violently and charged towards the tigers.\n\nSword qi condensed into vines beside the countless tigers and bound them. The vines had countless sword path thorns that pierced deep into the tigers.\n\nPainful roars of tigers resounded as most of them crumbled apart like balloons being popped.\n\nAt this time, the fire birds entered the battlefield.\n\nLin Jian Xing transferred his immortal essence as the sword qi in the battlefield were replenished, turning into fierce wind.\n\nThe fierce wind killed all the remaining tigers and blew away countless fire birds, the remaining few fire birds were unsteady and unable to gather into a formation again.\n\nThe blood light pillars smashed down, rapidly suppressing the fierce wind.\n\nLin Jian Xing was forced to move backwards. After pulling some distance, he release a large amount of sword qi.\n\nSword qi turned into ice walls that confined the blood light pillars and ground them constantly.\n\nLin Jian Xing neutralized three waves of attacks consecutively, showing his extremely profound sword path attainment.\n\nNine Spiritual Fairy did not stint on her praise: ”Lin clan’s first supreme elder’s methods have a unique style and are truly extraordinary. I can’t wait anymore, take this!”\n\nNine Spiritual Fairy turned into an immemorial desolate beast, her roars were like lightning as they shook even the rumor cage.\n\nNine Spiritual Fairy clashed with Lin Jian Xing, her attacks were filled with great strength, forcing Lin Jian Xing to move back again and again.\n\nLin Jian Xing continued to retreat, unable to ward off Nine Spiritual Fairy’s charge.\n\nTransformation path and strength path Gu cultivators had a unique advantage when they were vanguards in the battlefield.\n\nThe five Heavenly Court immortals continued to attack in turns, suppressing Lin Jian Xing since the start of the fight.\n\nAlthough their dao marks conflicted, they had an extremely tacit coordination.\n\nTheir attacks were like tidal waves, continuing without stopping. On one hand, they suppressed Lin Jian Xing, not giving him any chance or time to study rumor cage battlefield. On the other hand, they were weakening and wearing him down, creating a chance to capture him.\n\nLin Jian Xing’s sword qi were exquisite and profound, transforming into all kinds of shapes. His extraordinary sword path attainment made even the five Heavenly Court immortals sigh in awe.\n\nBut he was just one person after all, two fists cannot rival four hands, let alone when Heavenly Court had five people!\n\nAs time passed, the situation got increasingly disadvantageous for Lin Jian Xing.\n\n“Strange, what method did he use to suppress my flower thorn stab?” Wan Zi Hong was inwardly surprised at seeing Lin Jian Xing moving so freely.\n\nRight at this time, Prince Feng Xian suddenly used a killer move.\n\nAfter Lin Jian Xing was struck, grey flames burned all over his body.\n\nThe flames constantly produced fire birds. Lin Jian Xing’s momentum decreased rapidly as his speed also had an obvious reduction.\n\nSeeing the chance, Red Heart Traveler immediately used his killer move, blood sun seal!\n\nHe coughed out a mouthful of blood.\n\nThe fragrant blood flew to the air and started rotating. Like a miniature blood sun, it emitted endless blood red light as it rushed towards Lin Jian Xing.\n\nLin Jian Xing was surrounded by sword qi; at this moment, the sword qi flew and turned into a giant python that tried to stop the blood sun.\n\nBut this blood sun seemed to be illusory, it passed through the obstruction and struck Lin Jian Xing’s chest, turning into a red sun insignia.\n\nLin Jian Xing’s expression changed slightly.\n\nThe blood sun insignia showed its effect quickly, it formed into blood red lines.\n\nThe blood lines covered Lin Jian Xing, gradually forming a blood cocoon.\n\nIt seemed like Lin Jian Xing was about to be captured alive; but at the next moment, Lin Jian Xing’s body crumbled apart, turning into a powerful wave of sword qi that slipped out of the blood cocoon.\n\nAfter flying outside, these sword qi condensed back into Lin Jian Xing.\n\n“He can even do this?”\n\n“No, something is not right!”\n\n“This is not Lin clan’s first supreme elder.”\n\nThe five Heavenly Court immortals’ expressions’ changed as they noticed an issue after seeing the situation.\n\nThey shockingly found that the trapped Lin Jian Xing was not the Gu Immortal himself, but only a killer move.\n\nAll along, the five immortals had been toyed around until now when they discovered it.\n\n“He is only a lump of sword qi, no wonder my flower thorn stab had no effect.”\n\n“So that’s it, this was not Lin clan’s first supreme elder, that’s why he did not try to evade when I used rumor cage.”\n\nZhou Xiong Xin’s expression was unsightly as he canceled the battlefield killer move.\n\nThe five immortals once again appeared in Lin clan’s public blessed land.\n\nThe true Lin clan’s first supreme elder Lin Jian Xing was standing in the air with his hands behind his back, showing a smile as he looked at the five immortals: ”You finally came out.”\n\n“Lin Jian Xing, truly formidable. I wonder what the name of this move is called?” Red Heart Traveler smiled warmly as he asked.\n\nLin Jian Xing nodded slightly and explained: ”This move is called sword qi takes form.”\n\n“Sword qi takes form, truly a great move!” Prince Feng Xian praised sincerely.\n\n“After this battle, no matter what happens to you, this move will definitely be renowned throughout the five regions.” Zhou Xiong Xin commented.\n\nAlthough they were played, the five Heavenly Court immortals only looked grim-faced but had no loss in confidence or battle intent.\n\nIn the battle inside rumor cage, they were also suppressed.\n\nAfter all, rumor cage created an information path environment which suppressed four of the Heavenly Court immortals. They did not dare to use all their strength in fear of breaking the rumor cage.\n\nEven if it was not destroyed, if there were great impacts, the battlefield would still be broken and reveal gaps from which Lin Jian Xing could escape.\n\nLin Jian Xing stretched out his palm and showed several Immortal Gu that were bound by sword qi: ”Heavenly Court’s immortal formation is truly amazing, it seemed to have been modified to specifically target my clan’s public blessed land. Is this Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s method?”\n\nThe five Heavenly Court immortals could not conceal their serious expressions.\n\nThe formation they had secretly arranged outside of Lin clan’s public blessed land was already taken down by Lin Jian Xing.\n\nBut at the next moment, Lin Jian Xing waved his hand, throwing the Immortal Gu to the Heavenly Court immortals: ”The Immortal Gu have been returned to you. This is my clan’s headquarters, it won’t be nice if we destroy it, let’s change the location of our fight.”\n\nThe five Heavenly Court immortals quietly received the Immortal Gu and looked at each other. Finally, Red Heart Traveler nodded: ”You have unparalleled grace, I am in admiration.”\n\n“There is a desolate area three thousand li from here, please follow me.” Lin Jian Xing flew out of the blessed land, moving at a slow speed with an indifferent attitude.\n\nThe Heavenly Court immortals followed closely after."
