With just a thought, these two Immortal Gu would self-detonate.\n\n“Thank you.” Chu Du said as he kept Pang Shan’s will in his immortal aperture directly.\n\nThis small detail was noticed by Fang Yuan, he noted it internally.\n\nThe immortal aperture was the basis of a Gu Immortal, it was the most reliable source of resources, one would not expose it to outsiders normally. Chu Du seemed to greatly trust Pang Shan.\n\nChu Du said to Not Immortal’s will: “Not Immortal, you can stay with this ally of mine.”\n\nNot Immortal stroked his beard, smiling at Fang Yuan: “My main body guessed correctly, you really chose this person.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Fang Yuan asked, he was filled with questions and suspicions on this trip to Crazed Demon Cave.\n\nChu Du explained: “I will summarize it. Crazed Demon Cave is one of the ten great fierce areas in Northern Plains on the surface, but it was actually specially created by Limitless Demon Venerable in his later years, to pursue the secrets of eternal life.”\n\n“Limitless Demon Venerable refined the legendary derivation Gu, he hid inside Crazed Demon Cave and did experiments and Gu refinements on it, hoping to reach a breakthrough.”\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable!\n\nEternal life!\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined brightly: “Did Limitless Demon Venerable succeed?”\n\nNot Immortal’s will shook his head: “We are unclear on that. Limitless Demon Venerable’s whereabouts are not listed clearly in historical records. The conclusion is, he went missing mysteriously, whether he succeeded or failed, we do not know.”\n\n“However.” Not Immortal’s will said: “What Chu Du said is true. Crazed Demon Cave was indeed where Limitless Demon Venerable stayed in his later years, derivation Gu is currently at the deepest layer of Crazed Demon Cave. Around derivation Gu, there is a huge super Gu formation set up.”\n\n“Derivation Gu…” Fang Yuan muttered.\n\nThis Gu was extremely famous, not just Gu Immortals, even almost all Gu Masters knew about it.\n\nThe reason was that it was inside <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>.\n\nTowards the end of <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>, after the seven heavens broke, Ren Zu’s ten children died one by one, and Ren Zu was about to die of old age. But at the end, Ren Zu gathered the corpses of his ten children and sacrificed himself, all entering the stomach of derivation Gu. Derivation Gu’s stomach burst, exploding as the light of life spread across the land, creating the first batch of mortals. These mortals did not have Ren Zu or the ten children’s aptitude, but they could cultivate after awakening their aperture.\n\nHumanity thus grew and developed, forming today’s size. During this process, ten rank nine venerables were born, each of them led their own era and left deep marks on the world.\n\nEventually, today’s situation in the five regions was formed.\n\n“Limitless Demon Venerable actually obtained derivation Gu, was he trying to imitate Ren Zu, and create the human race again?” Fang Yuan sighed in shock as he asked.\n\n“That’s not the case.” Not Immortal answered: “Ren Zu created humanity, it is an unparalleled method of human path. Limitless Demon Venerable, however, cultivated rule path, he wanted to use derivation Gu to derive new dao marks, eventually using these dao marks as clues to reach eternal life.”\n\n“Using derivation Gu to derive dao marks?” Fang Yuan was shocked.\n\nChu Du nodded: “Even though this is the estimation of the Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics, Crazed Demon Cave has physical proof of it. The demonic sounds inside Crazed Demon Cave were the result of Limitless Demon Venerable’s super Gu formation. His motive was not to make all the living beings go crazy, that was only the side effect, his true motive was to cause changes in the dao marks in their bodies, to create brand new dao marks.”\n\n“So that’s it!” Fang Yuan’s mind shook, he thought about it and asked: “Does that really work?”\n\nNot Immortal followed up: “The deeper you go into Crazed Demon Cave, the stronger the demonic sounds. Among chaotic dao marks, new dao marks do indeed form. But these new dao marks will be transferred to the deepest layer due to the super Gu formation, us Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics want to get through these obstacles of dao marks and enter the core of the super Gu formation, to control derivation Gu and make this super Gu formation work for us!”\n\n“Precisely as a result, the Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics need my strength.” Chu Du said.\n\nFang Yuan realized at once, he had a guess.\n\nAs expected, Chu Du’s following words affirmed his guess.\n\n“At the lowest layer, all sorts of dao marks of all paths are present. The Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics have their own specialties, but their strength path attainment is below mine. Thus, they invited me, wanting to use my understanding towards strength path and methods to resolve their obstacles in terms of strength path dao marks.”\n\nNot Immortal’s will sighed: “It is not about helping us Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics, it is about helping yourselves. We, the Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics have been in Crazed Demon Cave for hundreds of years. Even though we are making progress, it is not evident. The secret of eternal life, it is not something the three of us can obtain with just our power. We need you, and you need us, only by working together can we obtained the fruits of Limitless Demon Venerable’s labor.”\n\nThe Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics went through hundreds of years without much progress, they could only recruit new people to help.\n\nChu Du was their target.\n\nAnd Chu Du thought that Fang Yuan was suitable, because of Reckless Savage’s true meaning, Chu Du felt that he was going to sustain his cooperation with Fang Yuan for a long time, they had to obtain deeper connections.\n\nThus, he gave the Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics’ token to Fang Yuan and asked him to find them.\n\nAmong the three eccentrics, Not Immortal and Pang Shan saw Chu Du’s intent, thus they were very warm to Fang Yuan.\n\n“Chu Du, you are a strength path great expert, right now in Northern Plains, no, in the five regions, you are an authoritative figure of strength path. It is not strange that you were chosen by the three seniors of Crazed Demon Cave, but what abilities do I have to be chosen?” Fang Yuan asked.\n\nChu Du laughed loudly: “Brother Liu, don’t be so humble. You are a transformation path rank seven Gu Immortal, you can disguise as a rank six without showing any flaws. I saw your tribulation, even though I only took a look, the power of the calamity was immense, it shows your deep foundation. Looking over the entire Northern Plains Gu Immortal world, in terms of transformation path achievement, hardly anyone can compete with you.”\n\n“What? He is a rank seven Gu Immortal?” Hearing Chu Du’s words, even Not Immortal’s will was shocked.\n\nHe assessed Fang Yuan again: “Impressive! His transformation path foundation is truly deep, be it my main body or Pang Shan’s main body, we could not tell.”\n\nFang Yuan smiled bitterly.\n\nThis was mainly due to his immortal killer move familiar face.\n\nOf course, there was also the impression left on Chu Du by the calamities.\n\nFamiliar face was indeed a transformation path immortal killer move.\n\nFang Yuan knew: even though his transformation path attainment level was not low, his foundation was superficial. He was relying on familiar face to make others misunderstand him.\n\nBut this misunderstanding was quite good.\n\nFang Yuan thus used familiar face to raise his aura from rank six to rank seven.\n\nNot Immortal felt Fang Yuan’s aura change and stared with wide opened eyes, completely shocked.\n\n“I was not intending to deceive you, but I was going into a dangerous place, I had to conceal myself for survival, I hope you will not blame me.” Fang Yuan apologized to Not Immortal’s will, speaking politely and having a sincere tone.\n\nNot Immortal’s will quickly waved his hand: “I have learned much. Indeed, Domination Immortal has good foresight.”\n\nHis attitude had changed drastically.\n\nInteraction between Gu Immortals mostly depended on strength.\n\nChu Du was solemn: “Brother Liu, are you willing to join us in the search for the secret of eternal life, Limitless Demon Venerable’s achievement in his later years?”\n\n“Of course I am willing.” Fang Yuan was similarly solemn.\n\nNot Immortal’s will stroked his beard: “Then after this battle, can Brother Liu go to Crazed Demon Cave, we will set the Crazed Demon Agreement!”\n\n“Alright.” Fang Yuan replied curtly.\n\n“Next, Not Immortal can follow Brother Liu.” Chu Du arranged.\n\nThis arrangement was very sincere!\n\nIf Chu Du kept Not Immortal and Pang Shan’s will, he would have both Immortal Gu ‘No’ and ‘Care’. He would be able to break his agreement without facing backlash.\n\nBut if he separated both Immortal Gu, ‘no’ Immortal Gu would be in Fang Yuan’s hand, while care Immortal Gu would be with Chu Du, not only can it dispel Fang Yuan’s suspicions, it would also let Fang Yuan feel the sincerity of Chu Du and the Three Crazed Demon Eccentrics.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan waved his hand, saying something overbearing: “If both of you can trust me, I will keep ‘no’ Immortal Gu. Not Immortal’s will and immortal essence can be kept by brother Chu.”\n\nNot Immortal’s will was dazed before stroking his beard.\n\nChu Du laughed: “Brother Liu, oh, you are seriously vigilant. Alright, we will go with that.”"
