  "content": "1966 Great Era! “Feng Jiu Ge!” Duke Long screamed, charging towards him.\n\nImmortal killer move — Dragon Claw Strike!\n\nImmortal killer move — Spiraling Dragon Fang!\n\nClaw marks emerged, nearly ten feet long, cutting through the air with invincible might. Dragon fangs flew everywhere, like piercing sharp blades, circling and flying while emitting murderous aura.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge retreated slowly as he continued to sing his destiny song.\n\nAround him, there were several clones, they looked like him but had mystical powers.\n\nImmortal killer move — Song Warrior!\n\nSong warriors fought for Feng Jiu Ge, not only blocking the dragon claws and fangs but even fighting against Duke Long.\n\nAfter several rounds, Duke Long destroyed a song warrior.\n\nBut next, a brand new song warrior appeared on the battlefield, engaging with Duke Long in combat.\n\nDuke Long instantly understood that killing these clones was pointless, the true way to fight was to go after the source, to directly deal with Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nImmortal killer move — Dragon Gate.\n\nDuke Long crossed a large distance and approached Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge calmly activated yang pass tune as he pulled apart their distance once again.\n\nDuke Long was unable to fight Feng Jiu Ge in close combat, he could only use qi path killer moves to attack at a distance.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge showed no fear, his destiny song continued to weaken Duke Long while he used his hands to unleash the triple extreme sound killer move, with drum fist, bell palm, and finger whistle.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge fought against Duke Long while exchanging many blows, they unexpectedly were evenly matched!\n\nRank eight future self brought a qualitative transformation to Feng Jiu Ge’s battle strength.\n\nWhile the three regions’ Gu Immortals hesitated on whether to help Feng Jiu Ge, they were shocked to realize: Feng Jiu Ge did not need anyone’s help!\n\nThe battle strength he displayed shocked everyone.\n\nDuke Long was unable to take down Feng Jiu Ge, he was shocked and furious. At this point, he realized that even though Feng Jiu Ge was fighting earlier, he had been keeping his true strength hidden, he did not use his full power at all.\n\nRight now, Duke Long wanted to destroy Red Lotus’ scheme. But Fang Yuan was a tough enemy, Duke Long knew about his strength, so he chose to fight Feng Jiu Ge instead.\n\nAs long as Feng Jiu Ge was disrupted and destiny song failed to activate, then Fang Yuan and the others would not have the Immortal Gu recipe, they would not succeed.\n\nBut Feng Jiu Ge’s strength far exceeded Duke Long’s expectations, he could only attack more aggressively while trying to take down Feng Jiu Ge as soon as possible.\n\nDuke Long was stalled by Feng Jiu Ge, while Wu Shuai controlled Dragon Palace to defend Fang Yuan’s main body, Calamity Luck Altar was blocking Demon Judgment Board.\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals unleashed a storm of attacks but the other three regions’ Gu Immortals and Di Zang Sheng stopped them.\n\nThe battle situation was tilting in the favor of the three regions’ Gu Immortals, but Fang Yuan was facing a problem now.\n\nThe sea of human wills was vast and turbulent.\n\nUsing the human wills as Gu material to refine destiny Gu was wishful thinking.\n\nBut it was a possible method.\n\nUnder the effect of destiny song, the human wills and flames merged, refined into a mystical Gu material that was formless and colorless.\n\nFang Yuan, who was controlling this Gu refinement session, had to endure the terrifying waves of human wills. He had to calm the human wills like subduing tides, sending them to the respective tributaries.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression quickly turned dark, his veins were bulging on his forehead, thoughts collided endlessly in his mind, he could not keep up with this expenditure, his storage of thoughts was rapidly used up, about to be emptied!\n\nAt the periphery of the battlefield, Spectral Soul and his servants kept a close watch on the situation.\n\nFairy Zi Wei saw Fang Yuan’s expression as she analyzed: “Oh no, Fang Yuan is not in good shape. I know about his wisdom path foundation, he is most skilled at blocking deductions and concealing his true location. But this refinement expends his thoughts and focuses on his cognitive ability. The sea of human will is truly terrifying, even I myself cannot last long in it.”\n\nBut Spectral Soul smiled lightly, saying calmly: “Don’t worry, a certain venerable has already prepared for this. Fang Yuan should know what to do.”\n\nSpectral Soul could not help but recall the past.\n\nWhen he was still alive, exploring Eighty-Eight True Yang Building.\n\nThere, he found wisdom Gu, he also saw Giant Sun’s special will left behind by Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\nBack then, he wanted to immediately take wisdom Gu for himself.\n\n“Spectral Soul, I would like you to let wisdom Gu remain here.” Giant Sun’s special will had to show up and stop him.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable smiled coldly: “You can’t stop me.”\n\nGiant Sun’s special will nodded: “Of course, you are the current Demon Venerable, invincible in the world, I have no way of stopping you. But I am sure you have made a deal with Red Lotus Demon Venerable already?”\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable’s expression changed, before coming here, he had obtained one Red Lotus true inheritance, he made a deal with Red Lotus Demon Venerable.\n\n“You mean to say?” Spectral Soul Demon Venerable hesitated.\n\n“That’s right, my main body has made arrangements in this wisdom Gu. When the crucial person arrives, he will destroy Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, this wisdom Gu will go along with him.” Giant Sun’s special will said openly.\n\n“So that’s it.” Spectral Soul Demon Venerable looked at wisdom Gu deeply but did not take it.\n\nAt this moment.\n\n“I’ve already given it my best effort… it seems I need to use wisdom Gu after all.” Fang Yuan sighed.\n\nBy now, he had already guessed many of the venerable arrangements.\n\nWisdom Gu was Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s arrangement, but unlike those of Primordial Origin Immortal Venerable and Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable, it had activated long ago. Back then, Fang Yuan was unaware of this.\n\nFang Yuan had just opened his immortal aperture’s entrance when wisdom Gu flew out by itself, floating above Fang Yuan as it emitted a divine radiance.\n\nFang Yuan instantly felt relaxed as his expression went back to normal, he felt a sense of ease.\n\n“So that’s it.” He inspected it closely, realizing: “Wisdom Gu is one of the Gu materials, no wonder it is so effective. With the addition of wisdom Gu, my thoughts are expended more slowly, but my immortal essence expenditure is huge. This rate of consumption is not something I can sustain.”\n\nEven though the sovereign immortal aperture’s rate of time was very fast and could accumulate immortal essence rapidly, Fang Yuan had undergone many intense battles, the expenditure was high as well.\n\nOnce he fails to keep up with the expenditure, the Gu refinement would be forced to stop, Fang Yuan would suffer an overwhelmingly terrifying backlash!\n\nBut Fang Yuan was not flustered, he was cool as ice.\n\nHe knew clearly, at this point in time, the venerables were not going to watch by the side.\n\nAs long as he still had a trace of value, he was irreplaceable, the venerables could not allow him to die at this moment.\n\n“Next, it should be your turn to take action, Giant Sun…”\n\nFar away in black heaven, a dark gold palace floated quietly in the sky.\n\nIn the palace, immortal zombie Giant Sun slowly opened his eyes.\n\nHe looked towards the south, the scenes in Heavenly Court were reflected in his eyes.\n\n“We have finally reached this moment.” Immortal zombie Giant Sun smiled before sighing to himself lightly: “Red Lotus, it was your scheme that worked after all.”\n\nCertain memories in his life started to surface.\n\nOn the stone lotus island, Gu Immortal Giant Sun who had yet to become venerable received Red Lotus’ gift.\n\nAt the same time, they also made a transaction.\n\n“This is the incomplete Immortal Gu recipe of destiny Gu?” Giant Sun received this incomplete recipe and was immediately drawn to it. He was the creator of luck path, it had never failed him, but from this incomplete recipe, he saw a whole new world!\n\n“Red Lotus, you are the one who damaged fate Gu, giving me the chance to create luck path. Now, you are gifting this incomplete recipe of destiny Gu to me, I owe you an immense favor!” Gu Immortal Giant Sun said solemnly.\n\n“I will make the arrangements according to our agreement. I will leave wisdom Gu behind and create responsive luck Immortal Gu to help that unparalleled genius who will create destiny song. Furthermore, I will retain my final attack, as long as the situation advances to reach that stage, I will take action and help your million year plan succeed!”\n\nRed Lotus’ will smiled: “I will thank you in advance. If my plan fails, please follow our agreement and try your best to refine destiny Gu yourself.”\n\n“Of course!” Gu Immortal Giant Sun said resolutely.\n\n…\n\nWithin Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace, immortal zombie Giant Sun slowly raised his right hand.\n\nBoom—!\n\nAn enormous beam of light flew through the sky and shot towards Heavenly Court’s direction at an extreme speed.\n\nThis beam of light was so gigantic, like a large river that spanned across heaven and earth.\n\nWherever it went, it pushed aside all the air, the beam’s movement was accompanied by a deafening and majestic sound.\n\nSuch a grand and powerful killer move shocked everyone and sent them into a daze.\n\nEven Duke Long, Feng Jiu Ge, and Fang Yuan felt incredibly small and insignificant upon seeing this move.\n\nThe beam of light started from black heaven above Northern Plains, piercing through the regional wall and directly bombarding Heavenly Court.\n\nHeavenly Court shook intensely, the world seemed to tremble as countless Immortal Gu Houses cracked and broke.\n\nWithin Imperfection Regret Pavilion, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s silhouette gritted her teeth.\n\nShe watched as Giant Sun’s attack approached, but Limitless’ silhouette was drawing her attention, forcing her to have no time to deal with it.\n\nGiant Sun’s attack landed with unstoppable might, instilling itself into the sea of human wills and flames.\n\nThe three sources gathered and instantly formed a golden ball of light that was the size of a mountain.\n\nWithin the ball of light, flames flicked, human wills shined with rainbow light, incredibly dazzling. Fang Yuan remained unmoved at the center, he was controlling the situation.\n\nTraces of pale white light started to spread out from his tightly grasped hands.\n\nThese traces of light were so familiar, Fang Yuan had a deep impression of them.\n\nHe was internally shaken: “Heaven path dao marks!”\n\nTens or hundreds of heaven path dao marks slipped out from the cracks between his fingers.\n\nFang Yuan opened his hands wide at this moment, with a loud sound, countless heaven path dao marks flew into the sky, entangling with each other.\n\nTraces of dao marks went towards Fang Yuan’s body.\n\nFang Yuan grunted, intense pain assaulted him, causing his body and mind to shake!\n\n“These are newly added heaven path dao marks on my body? Wait no, not just me…” Fang Yuan’s eyes shined with bright light, he acutely sensed that many of the heaven path dao marks vanished all of a sudden, following the sources of the human wills.\n\n“As expected.” At this moment, Fang Yuan was finally certain about Red Lotus Demon Venerable’s plan.\n\nHe wanted to refine destiny Gu but he was not truly trying to refine a Gu.\n\nFang Yuan grasped this chance, doing his best to collect these heaven path dao marks.\n\nWith every single heaven path dao mark carved in his body, his sovereign immortal aperture’s foundation would rise by a level.\n\nThis was an unprecedented and huge fortuitous encounter!\n\nEach complete heaven path dao mark would cause a small qualitative change in Fang Yuan’s immortal aperture world.\n\nAfter his trip to Crazed Demon Cave, Fang Yuan became even clearer of the immense value of this opportunity.\n\nBut the fusing of heaven path dao marks was very painful, even someone with a firm mind like Fang Yuan started to feel dizzy after gaining ten complete heaven path dao marks.\n\nBut he was the main person refining this Gu, he could not use other methods, otherwise, he would disrupt the Gu refinement and fail the process, that would be a huge problem.\n\nFang Yuan relied on his determination as he gritted his teeth and held on.\n\nHe was not the only Gu Immortal enduring pain, he was just one of countless people.\n\nAt the same time, in the vast five regions, countless mortals screamed in pain, the heaven path dao marks found their way to the sources of the human wills and carved themselves into these people’s bodies.\n\nEach of these mortals could not endure even one ten-thousandth of a complete heaven path dao mark, many of them fainted at the first moment.\n\nThose who could remain awake were fortunate, they were able to absorb more heaven path dao marks.\n\nPain!\n\nIntense pain, pain that went beyond words.\n\nFang Yuan soon tore the skin of his lips as his eyes opened wide, even the corners of his eyes were torn, blood flowed out.\n\nHis entire body was shaking and covered in sweat, he still tried his best to continue fusing with each additional heaven path dao mark.\n\nSoon, the Gu Immortals scattered across the five regions also started to endure this process.\n\nHeavenly Court’s fighting came to a stop, all of the Gu Immortals’ expressions changed, they gritted their teeth as their faces turned red. With the addition of heaven path dao marks that automatically went to them, they were caught off guard and could barely endure this.\n\n“No—!” Duke Long screamed in agony, at this moment, he finally realized what Red Lotus’ plan was.\n\nDuke Long was unable to take down Feng Jiu Ge after so long, he could only turn around and hope for the best as he tried to attack Fang Yuan, but the intense pain also assaulted him.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge persisted in using destiny song, seeing that Duke Long was leaving, he quickly attacked more intensely to stall for time instead.\n\nWith a loud sound, like splattering water, the mountain-like human wills vanished on the spot.\n\nSuccess!\n\n“People of this world, I have entrusted fate to you. All of you hold a portion of fate, from today onwards, there will no longer be fate in this world!” Red Lotus’ will spoke through the human wills, his voice was transmitted into the minds of everyone in the five regions.\n\nThe five regions’ humans were still in agony and indescribable pain.\n\nBecause of the intense and unbearable pain, there were many cases of suicide on the spot.\n\n“Red Lotus—!” Duke Long shouted in anger, he finally got away from Feng Jiu Ge as he arrived in front of Fang Yuan.\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe last bit of Red Lotus’ will managed to gather into human form as it blocked the ferocious Duke Long for Fang Yuan.\n\n“Master.” The young looking Red Lotus smiled: “I succeeded at long last. Fate Gu has been split into countless portions by me and distributed to everyone in this world. It still exists, it has not been destroyed, but because fate has been fused with luck, it can no longer be used by heaven’s will.”\n\nDuke Long was furious, his eyes were red, his hair standing on end.\n\n“Traitorous disciple!” He screamed, he charged even quicker now.\n\nAt the next moment, he completely destroyed Red Lotus’ will as he arrived in front of Fang Yuan.\n\nDuke Long’s aura broke through its limit again, reaching an unprecedented level, his strength was so overwhelming that even Di Zang Sheng and Feng Jiu Ge felt a threat to their lives!\n\nFang Yuan did not move, he did not even put up a defense.\n\nDuke Long charged with unparalleled might, but when he was still a step away from Fang Yuan, his expression changed.\n\nHis aura froze at once, his advancement stopped.\n\nHis lifespan — was exhausted!\n\nIt was slightly earlier than in the previous life.\n\nFang Yuan was not surprised, he had found the truth when he saw a bit of the scattered light earlier.\n\nThe truth was, back then in Eastern Sea, when his Qi Sea Ancestor identity used steal life on Duke Long, it was effective.\n\nBut the effect was low and not easily observable, Duke Long also had incredible concealment abilities.\n\nAfterwards, in order to avoid fighting Qi Sea Ancestor, Duke Long even took out Primordial Origin’s true inheritance to successfully deceive everyone. This was because Duke Long did not know that Fang Yuan’s steal life killer move had a limited number of usages.\n\nThis also caused Duke Long to become even stronger than in the previous life at the same time period.\n\nThe hero of a generation, the pillar of Heavenly Court, the master of Red Lotus, and the creator of the dragonman race — Duke Long!\n\nFinally, his life was over.\n\nBefore dying, he still charged at the forefront.\n\nFor Heavenly Court, for the sake of humanity, he had truly done everything that he could until his death.\n\nDuring the intense war, he forgot the limit of his own lifespan. Thus, at the moment of his death, other than rage and killing intent, there was also confusion on his face.\n\n“Lord Duke Long…”\n\n“Damn it, you must be feeling very unwilling to die like this!”\n\n“Senior Duke Long!!!”\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals cried out loud, their morale rose sharply, this was the will of the mourning troops!\n\nIntense battle occurred again, the Gu Immortals of the three regions were actually suppressed by Heavenly Court which had fewer numbers.\n\nFang Yuan no longer participated in the fight.\n\nHe still endured intense pain as his gaze pierced past Heavenly Court, overlooking the entire five regions.\n\nEarth shook as it produced waves of deep, rumbling noises.\n\nAt this moment, the regional walls that separated the five regions had completely disappeared. The earth veins were connected as the five separate regions merged into one!\n\nWithout the obstruction of the regional walls, people could freely move through the five regions with no obstructions. At the same time, the differences in heaven and earth qi also disappeared gradually.\n\nThe bloody cape on Fang Yuan’s back slowly disintegrated, he raised his head slightly and took in a deep breath.\n\nAh, the air was filled with freedom.\n\nFrom now on, there was finally a possibility of pursuing eternal life.\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan’s lips curled up as he revealed a faint smile.\n\n“The great era… has finally arrived!”"
