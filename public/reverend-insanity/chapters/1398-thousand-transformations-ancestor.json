  "content": "The sun was blazing, the rays were like countless arrows shooting down at this majestic desert.\n\nOn this desert, there were countless sand statues.\n\nThese statues made from sand had the forms of humans or beasts, some were fighting while some were lying down, looking like they were on their final breaths.\n\nThere were larger and smaller sand statues, but the smallest one was tens of feet tall.\n\nCountless statues formed a forest of sand statues, it was a grand sight.\n\nIt was the myriad statue desert!\n\nThis desert was huge, there were countless sand statues in it, everyone in Western Desert’s Gu Immortal world knew about it.\n\nIt had a long history, it was formed during the Olden Antiquity Era, and had been around for over a million years.\n\nThis desert was formed from a particularly important situation in human history.\n\nIt was during Reckless Savage Demon Venerable’s era, a huge battle was fought here between humans and variant humans, after a hundred days and night, rivers of blood flowed, almost turning into a sea.\n\nDuring that era, transformation path was the mainstream path.\n\nIn the battle, humans won a pyrrhic victory, be it the humans or the variant humans, large numbers of Gu Immortals died here.\n\nTheir immortal fetuses formed into blessed lands, their dao marks spread out and changed the environment.\n\nGradually, this became the myriad statue desert. The sand moved on its own, growing like trees at a slow rate each year, eventually turning into huge statues.\n\nThis was the former location of the great battle where the different races fought from day until night, countless life forms died. But fortune and disaster coexisted, this place became a sanctuary for cultivation as it was now filled with resources.\n\nEvery sand statue was an immortal material filled with transformation path dao marks if it was at least sixty feet tall.\n\nThere were no longer any blessed lands here, after a million years, these blessed lands were either destroyed by tribulations or taken by Gu Immortals.\n\nBut here, there were countless wild Gu worms and even wild Immortal Gu.\n\nNobody would step here rashly.\n\nBecause the environment was too dense with dao marks, mortals could not traverse the desert, it was too dangerous for them.\n\nAs for Western Desert Gu Immortals, they would also make a detour when they came here.\n\nBecause of one person.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor!\n\nThis rank eight Gu Immortal, specialized in transformation path, had been here for a thousand years.\n\nThe might of rank eight deterred everyone from antagonizing him.\n\nMyriad statue desert was Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s territory, any Gu Immortal who entered without his permission would need to prepare to face the fury of a rank eight.\n\nDeep below the desert, in Myriad Statue Palace.\n\nDeep within the palace, in an eerie dark corner, there was a painful cry that could be heard.\n\n“Ahhhhhh—!”\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor raised his head and screamed, he seemed to be in great pain, his expression was terrifying.\n\nEvery time he shouted, sound waves could be seen spreading outwards.\n\nBut when these sound waves landed on the palace walls, there would be a veil of light that absorbed all the sound waves rapidly.\n\nBecause of these walls isolating him, all of the commotion from Thousand Transformations Ancestor could not be felt outside.\n\nPain!\n\nIntense pain!\n\nAn unbearable pain was assaulting Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s mind and body.\n\nHis forehead had popping veins, he could not take it anymore, he rolled around the ground in pain.\n\nIf any other Gu Immortal saw this, they would be deeply shocked. What was the reason that made Thousand Transformations Ancestor suffer such intense torture, to have lost all of his rank eight demeanor?\n\nCling, clang!\n\nMore than ten thick chains coiled around Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s body, his four limbs were connected to chains that stabbed deeply into the surrounding walls.\n\nSeeing this, Thousand Transformations Ancestor was actually imprisoned?!\n\n“No, this cannot continue, I am going to go crazy completely, the intense pain will engulf all my reason and make me a lunatic! Rank eight myriad tribulation, even the first one is so terrifying, how can I deal with the next two?”\n\nDamn it!\n\nThe final bit of clarity in Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s eyes struggled.\n\nUsing this last bit of sanity, Thousand Transformations Ancestor made his choice!\n\nImmortal killer move — Cutting Flesh Transformation!\n\nHe activated his killer move, he was extremely familiar with this move, at the crucial moment, even though he was in deep pain, the activation did not fail.\n\nThis rank eight immortal killer move had grand aura.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor’s immortal body started to expand.\n\nLike he was a balloon, he became larger and larger, from a muscular middle aged man into a round and fat meatball.\n\nThe fat Thousand Transformations Ancestor shook his body as soft sounds could be heard from within him.\n\nSwoosh swoosh swoosh…\n\nAlong with the sound, a meat lump appeared on the side of his neck.\n\nThe meat lump became larger and larger, it inflated like a balloon.\n\nHis pain intensified!\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor gritted his teeth, his face had swollen up, his eyes could not be seen anymore.\n\nGuh.\n\nSoon, after the meat lump on his neck grew to the size of a face, it reached its limits and exploded.\n\nThe meat lump exploded as yellow pus splattered, a year beast jumped out and landed on the ground.\n\nWoof woof woof!\n\nAfter this year beast landed, it started to bark, it was a dog year beast.\n\nAnd its aura was not weak, it was a desolate year beast.\n\nAfter the dog year beast landed on the ground, Thousand Transformations Ancestor felt a bit of relief. It was as if he was carrying a mountain on his back, and now, a rock had been lifted off that mountain.\n\nSwoosh swoosh swoosh…\n\nNext, on Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s body, more meat lumps appeared.\n\nPuff puff puff.\n\nIn a short time, these meat lumps expanded and exploded, as pus oozed out and year beasts appeared.\n\nChicken, monkey, sheep, rabbit, all sorts of year beasts appeared.\n\nThese year beasts were not just desolate beast level, there were also some ancient year beasts.\n\nAfter some time, the year beasts gathered and attacked Thousand Transformations Ancestor!\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor was not surprised, his expression became more relaxed instead.\n\nHis pain was greatly reduced, even though it was still painful, it was at a bearable level now.\n\nAgainst the attack of a dozen year beasts, Thousand Transformations Ancestor snorted as he willed.\n\nCling clang!\n\nCountless thick chains shot out from the surrounding walls at lightning speed.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, all of the year beasts were captured and suppressed, no matter how they struggled inside the palace.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor let out a breath of air: “I can finally catch a breather.”\n\nHe grabbed the snake year beast closest to him and observed it with his methods.\n\nThe snake year beast continued to hiss as it exposed its tongue, it wanted to bite Thousand Transformations Ancestor but was restrained and could not move.\n\nA moment later, Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s expression was unchanged, but he was deeply shocked.\n\n“I used all my methods earlier, but this snake year beast still has such great animosity against me, it wants me dead.”\n\n“My cutting flesh transformation is one of the styles of an immortal killer move from Reckless Savage true inheritance, suicide transformation. Whenever I use it, life forms would be produced from my body, regardless of form, they will be manipulated like my limbs, I can use them freely. Because they are a portion of my body to begin with.”\n\n“But these year beasts were produced from my body, yet I cannot control them, even with all my methods, they are useless.”\n\n“Such an amazing myriad tribulation!”\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor’s forehead produced a drop of sweat.\n\nHe thought about his tribulation half a month ago, he was still feeling lingering fear from it.\n\nRank eight Gu Immortals had to go through three myriad tribulations.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor had just gone through the first.\n\n“If not for this Immortal Gu House left behind by Reckless Savage Demon Venerable, I would not be able to survive the first myriad tribulation at all. Even though I passed it now, I am still severely injured, I had to use cutting flesh transformation to cut my losses short.”\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor wanted to find some other way around it, but after half a month, he reached his limit and could not endure it anymore.\n\nWithout a choice, he could only use cutting flesh transformation to discard a portion of his immortal body, and get rid of the part of his body that was heavily injured.\n\nThis time, he met with a time path myriad tribulation, the injuries on him were all of time path dao marks.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor got rid of all these time path dao marks using cutting flesh transformation, abandoning them.\n\nThis way, the cutting flesh transformation turned them into year beasts.\n\nAnd because they were filled with heaven’s will, these year beasts were not under his control, they were his enemies.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor felt great loss.\n\nThe costs were too severe.\n\nNot just the near catastrophic damage to his immortal aperture from the myriad tribulation.\n\nLooking at the dao marks he lost from cutting flesh transformation, not only did he lose the time path dao marks, he even lost his own transformation path dao marks.\n\nThe dao marks losses were too huge.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor counted, after this myriad tribulation, not only did he not have any growth in dao marks, he even made a small loss instead!\n\n“This means, I was better off not going through the tribulation?”\n\nThinking of this, the experienced Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s heart felt some bitterness.\n\nHe sighed deeply.\n\nIt could not be helped.\n\nIn the past, he had cultivated boldly and advanced quickly, facing his myriad tribulation, he had stalled it until recently, when he could no longer stall it anymore.\n\nEven though he passed the myriad tribulation, Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s foundation did not grow, he even became weaker in terms of dao marks.\n\n“I was wrong.”\n\n“A thousand years ago, by relying on this Reckless Savage true inheritance, I thought I would progress unhindered.”\n\n“Earthly calamities, heavenly tribulations, grand tribulations, I got through all of them easily, but the myriad tribulation is a completely different story!”\n\n“I underestimated the myriad tribulation’s power. These last years, I had unknowingly gotten more arrogant, this injury is both a blessing and a disaster to me.”\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor was a rank eight expert, he was naturally an incredible person.\n\nHe recalled his experiences and reflected on himself after this severe loss.\n\nRight at this time, outside the palace, a female immortal’s voice could be heard: “Lord husband, something happened. Sister Cui Bo’s life tablet Gu was broken, her soul lantern Gu has turned dim. She went to translocation desert, but none of us can contact her now, this is too important, I had no choice but to inform you!”"
