Hmm, you have burned some of my hair, it is a little more powerful than before.” This Murong tribe Gu Immortal spoke in a tranquil tone without a hint of frustration.\n\n“You!” Hao Zhen’s eyes seemed to spout fire from anger, but he was not able to retort.\n\nHis strongest killer move had no effect on this opponent.\n\n“Wonderful!”\n\n“He is indeed the Gu Immortal famous for his defense in Northern Plains.”\n\n“Murong Gang… this guy has not attacked at all and is only taking the beating passively. Elder Hao Zhen’s offense actually could not show any results.”\n\nBoth sides’ Gu Immortals exclaimed in surprise.\n\nFang Yuan killing Ye Lui Qun Xing had been an extremely heavy blow to the righteous path.\n\nTo turn the tide of the situation and raise morale, Gong Wan Ting immediately took measures to make Murong tribe’s strongest expert among their current group take action.\n\nIt was this burly man who seemed to be forged from steel — Murong Gang!\n\nChu Du was frowning again.\n\nHe sighed internally: “Just now, Ye Lui Qun Xing was killed, now there is Murong Gang. These Huang Jin tribes are indeed the overlords who have ruled Northern Plains for so many years, their accumulation is truly powerful.”\n\nAt this moment, Hao Zhen admitted his defeat and returned with a pale expression: “I am ashamed, I could not live up to your expectations.”\n\nChu Du consoled him with a few words.\n\nFang Yuan had not left for long, and he had fallen into the same awkward situation like before.\n\nHe looked at the immortals behind him, but found he had no capable people to send.\n\n“In my opinion, the strongest person among us is you, supreme elder. But, you cannot easily take the stage, I think you need to call back Elder Liu.” Immortal Wang suggested.\n\nHis suggestion was immediately approved by many Gu Immortals.\n\n“Right, Elder Liu’s strength is unfathomable, he can kill Murong Gang!”\n\n“Elder Liu killed Ye Lui Qun Xing easily, killing Murong Gang won’t be a problem for him.”\n\n“Elder Liu’s ancient sword dragon breath is too powerful.”\n\nEven Murong Gang spoke: “Domination Immortal, don’t send other minor characters. Besides you, the only one who can enter my, Murong Gang’s, eyes, is Liu Guan Yi. Bring him out, I would like to experience the power of his dragon breath.”\n\n“Damn it! He is actually looking down on us.” Chou Lao Wu was furious.\n\nHao Zhen clenched his fists: “If it were two on two, we could use wind thunder roar and wipe them out!”\n\nAfter seeing Fang Yuan’s power, Hao Zhen and Chou Lao Wu had no more dissatisfaction towards their position of third and fourth supreme elders.\n\nHao Zhen was only saying this to retain some face.\n\nActually, he was aware that his and Chou Lao Wu’s wind thunder roar was powerful, but it was not easy to use it and it required a safe environment.\n\nLike before, when Heavenly Lord Bai Zu attacked Hei Fan grotto-heaven, they were able to use wind thunder roar because they were protected by other Gu Immortals.\n\nEveryone was anticipating Fang Yuan’s reappearance.\n\nChu Du’s side hoped Fang Yuan could raise their might again.\n\nThe righteous path’s side hoped they could kill Fang Yuan. Avenging Ye Lui tribe was secondary, the main thing was that they wanted to kill this person to salvage their face!\n\nChu Du naturally also hoped Fang Yuan would take the stage again.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had not given any reply.\n\nChu Du could only smile bitterly at this, and could do nothing about it.\n\nHis and Fang Yuan’s relationship was of mutual benefits and they held equal status.\n\nLang Ya blessed land, inside a secret room in a cloud city.\n\nFang Yuan was sitting cross-legged on a prayer mat, his divine sense entering his immortal aperture.\n\nHe was merging green grape immortal essence and refining them into red date immortal essence.\n\nThis merging method was widely popular and was not anything new.\n\nCountless mortal Gu was moving on their specific trajectories, some were standing still, some emitted light, while some flew continuously.\n\nUnder the effect of these Gu worms, beads of green grape immortal essence were slowly but surely merging together.\n\nTens of thousands of green grape immortal essence were piled in this enormous mortal Gu formation.\n\nWith Fang Yuan’s continuous effort, there were already two beads of red date immortal essence produced at the bottom of the green grape immortal essence.\n\n“Hmm? Chu Du sent a letter again, it is still that Murong Gang… this is already the sixth letter.” Fang Yuan’s attention slightly diverted.\n\nShortly afterwards, he threw this information path mortal Gu aside, having no interest to even reply.\n\nWhat blood battle martial competition, I don’t give a f\\*ck!\n\nScrew off.\n\nIn any case, Fang Yuan’s agreement with Chu Sect was extremely loose. Besides some fundamental interests and principles, even if he suddenly did not want to do a task, or his interest waned, or he betrayed the sect, or he voluntarily left Chu Sect, he would receive no backlash.\n\nWhat was the nature of this blood battle martial competition?\n\nFang Yuan knew it was a political compromise.\n\nThis was a stage which Heavenly Lord Bai Zu and Yao Huang, two rank eights, had discussed and created. It was to restrict the scope of the conflict between one another. The basic purpose was to ensure both sides’ interests did not suffer loss beyond their bottom-line.\n\nYao Huang knew clearly that since Bai Zu tribe was already established, it could not be destroyed. At least, he alone was not able to do it.\n\nBecause on the opposing side was a rank eight Gu Immortal, Heavenly Lord Bai Zu. As long as he existed, Bai Zu tribe was as stable as a rock.\n\nUnless Longevity Heaven sent a powerful reinforcement, for example, a rank eight Gu Immortal.\n\nWhen he received the Longevity Edict, he was already reluctant. All he needed was to provide an explanation to deal with Longevity Heaven.\n\nHeavenly Lord Bai Zu did not want to provoke trouble, he had just created his tribe and wanted everything to move smoothly. However, the situation did not permit it. He could only swallow the bitter pill and face the Huang Jin tribes’ allied offense.\n\nJust this competition would do. They would not truly fight to the death!\n\nChu Du had seen through these two sides’ thoughts, and because he was coincidentally squeezed in between, he took a huge step forward and established Chu Sect, using Heavenly Lord Bai Zu’s might to test the response of Northern Plains’ righteous path. If it was accepted, he could expand Chu Sect, if it was not accepted, he would disband Chu Sect. The losses wouldn’t be huge and were of no concern.\n\nFrom Longevity Heaven’s standpoint, they naturally did not like seeing other bloodlines mixing in among the righteous path. All along, Northern Plains had been the world of the Huang Jin tribes. They were even more unwilling to see Chu Sect’s existence! The master-disciple relationship, compared to the bloodline system, were two different ideologies. Systems based on either one were always sensitive and on guard against the other.\n\nLongevity Heaven’s Gu Immortals were clear that once the master-disciple system was spread, it would greatly shake their tribal forces and benefits.\n\nCentral Continent was a clear example and the best evidence of this.\n\n“But Longevity Heaven is dreaming if they want to rely on just the Longevity Edict to destroy the alliance between Chu Sect and Bai Zu tribe.”\n\n“Unless they become more resolute and send out rank eight experts to kill Heavenly Lord Bai Zu!”\n\n“This world is all about strength.”\n\n“Hei tribe did not have a rank eight Gu Immortal to suppress the situation and had also lost their Immortal Gu House, with just some excuses, their fellow Huang Jin tribe members destroyed them.”\n\n“Bai Zu tribe is an outsider and not of Huang Jin bloodline, but there is Heavenly Lord Bai Zu, making it a completely different situation.”\n\n“Strength… strength…”\n\nFang Yuan’s thoughts lingered over this word.\n\nRank seven cultivation level.\n\nThis was an accomplishment, but to him, it was only another starting point.\n\n“The blood battle martial competition does not match my interests.”\n\n“I have the sovereign immortal aperture and can annex other immortal apertures, skipping calamities and tribulations to raise my cultivation and strength. This is a shortcut for cultivation, filled with slaughter and blood. But… I like it.”\n\n“I want chaos, the more chaos, the better!”\n\n“But the five regions chaotic war is still over four hundred years later! It is too far away, I can’t wait that long.”\n\n“I need to think of a way to make them fight. The blood battle martial competition is too gentle, how many can be killed? If there are no deaths, there won’t be blessed lands.”\n\n“There is also Lang Ya Sect and the four races alliance, hehe, if I let Northern Plains’ human Gu Immortals know of them, what will their response be? Regretfully, I am bound by alliance agreements. Although there is ‘Do Not Care’, it cannot resolve the underlying problem!”\n\nFang Yuan’s only worry was that the world wouldn’t be chaotic, sinister and dangerous thoughts started to rise up in his mind.\n\nHe did not intend to go to Blood Plain.\n\nThe sect’s enthusiastic anticipation and the enemy’s provocation, what value did they have?\n\nFang Yuan had to spend all his effort to kill Ye Lui Qun Xing. If his actions had slightly slowed, he would have lost the opportunity. Would those three Immortal Gu Houses just stay there like decorations?\n\nEspecially that Murong Gang, he was a tough foe, it would not be easy for Fang Yuan to defeat him, let alone kill him.\n\nSince the start of the battle, Chu Du’s side had lost many times, while the righteous path had not even lost one-third of the time.\n\nHehe, there definitely would be some internal conflicts of the sect involved in this.\n\nThis was a trick righteous path Gu Immortals liked to play.\n\nFang Yuan had first thought of going to Southern Border.\n\nOver these last days, he had adjusted his cultivation plan, using almost all his time and energy in refining dream path mortal Gu.\n\nIt was all preparation for that giant dream realm in Southern Border.\n\nBut he thought and thought, and felt the opportunity at this blood battle martial competition was truly too rare.\n\nAdding on that on Southern Border’s end, it was occupied by the righteous path whom had arranged a super Gu formation to tightly defend the giant dream realm, Fang Yuan felt it would be very difficult for him to meddle in and did not have any opening currently.\n\nThus, after Fang Yuan refined all the green grape immortal essence into red date immortal essence, he quietly left Lang Ya blessed land and arrived at Liu tribe’s territory.\n\nHe was going to do something bad."
