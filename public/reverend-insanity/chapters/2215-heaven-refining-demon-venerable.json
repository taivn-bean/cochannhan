Birds were chirping out loud, a warm sea breeze was blowing.\n\nThis place was some distance away from Eastern Sea’s Xia clan, it was not considered close.\n\n“This place will do.” Fang Yuan quickly descended, landing on a relatively small deserted island.\n\nSeveral investigative killer moves were activated, Fang Yuan had complete control over the island, he did not detect any threats or suspicious matters.\n\nFang Yuan directly took out the five regional limit formation.\n\nSoon, five colored smoke mixed together and enveloped the island, before spreading towards the sky and sea.\n\nIf he were still rank eight, after escaping from Crazed Demon Cave, he would choose the headquarters of Eastern Sea’s Xia clan, or go to immemorial white heaven in secret and hide himself to recuperate.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had rank nine cultivation level now, he was a venerable, he could do things openly without fear.\n\nIf Star Constellation Immortal Venerable or Giant Sun Immortal Venerable came to attack him now, Fang Yuan would be happy to see that happen.\n\nFang Yuan slowly shut his eyes as his divine sense peered into the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nHe had already accumulated several beads of rank nine immortal essence.\n\nRank eight immortal essence was known as white litchi immortal essence, rank nine immortal essence was slightly larger and looked like an apricot, it was orange-yellow in color.\n\nIt was yellow apricot immortal essence!\n\nFang Yuan was familiar with the appearance of rank nine immortal essence since long ago, because he had obtained Giant Sun’s immortal essence as well as Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s remaining immortal essence.\n\nBut now, he felt some surging emotions internally.\n\nAfter all, this was his personal yellow apricot immortal essence!\n\nUsing the yellow apricot immortal essence, Fang Yuan activated a method!\n\nRefinement path killer move — Refine Self!\n\nA pale yellow light that was the size of a fist flowed out from the area near Fang Yuan’s stomach. The yellow light flowed slowly around his entire body.\n\nThe emphasis was on Fang Yuan’s injuries.\n\nFang Yuan had over a hundred injuries, most of them were only dealt with superficially while he was on the way back.\n\nEven now, many of the wounds were still bleeding and covered in golden light or starlight specks, they were lingering on his bones, or his mashed up flesh.\n\nAs the pale yellow light appeared, all of the starlight and golden aurora was cleansed. This meant that the dao marks that Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable left on Fang Yuan’s body were all refined by him.\n\nBut the process of refinement was not comfortable, an intense pain could be felt.\n\nFang Yuan’s body was shivering, his expression turned pale, soon, sweat covered his forehead.\n\nEventually, the pale yellow light lingered on the area of Fang Yuan’s detached arm. After an hour, the light faded away.\n\nFang Yuan let out a breath of air, he finally relaxed.\n\nAfter resting for a moment, he immediately used a compound killer move, man as before.\n\nAt the next moment, his injuries were fully healed, his arm was also fully restored.\n\nBut when Fang Yuan exerted strength using that arm, he still felt a sense of weakness from it.\n\nBut this was already satisfactory to him.\n\nFang Yuan had severe injuries but Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable were also no better.\n\nHe was almost certain that their efficiency at healing injuries was lower than him.\n\nBecause Fang Yuan had the killer move refine self, this killer move could refine all of the dao marks on the Gu cultivator’s body into their own. The origin of this move was the killer move that Fang Yuan once used, self cleansing.\n\nUsing this, in the battle of Crazed Demon Cave, Fang Yuan refined all of the dao marks of the flying star killer move, countering Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s consecutive move.\n\nHis physical injuries were healed, while his soul was at its peak condition, Fang Yuan started to resolve the matter of the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nThe sovereign immortal aperture had a tribulation earlier because of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s killer move. At almost the same time, because of Fang Yuan’s secret manipulation, he challenged the Heavenly Dao and endured the chaotic disaster.\n\nThe entire sovereign immortal aperture suffered huge losses, its foundation had fallen, compared to before the Crazed Demon Cave expedition, it had about twenty percent remaining.\n\nIt was simply in tatters, this was a pitiful sight.\n\n“But I predicted that this would happen before the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, I prepared for it!”\n\nFang Yuan focused his mind, thoughts were expended, he activated another compound killer move — Landscape as Before.\n\nThe year essence pools and the sub-pools in various areas of the sovereign immortal aperture all opened their dams now.\n\nThe accumulated water of the River of Time formed into a vast silhouette under the effect of landscape as before, sweeping through the mini five regions as well as all the mini nine heavens.\n\nThe silhouette of the water of the River of Time soon receded entirely, but what remained were various resource points of mountains and rivers that were completely restored.\n\nThe Gu Immortals in the sovereign immortal aperture saw this sight and cheered loudly, their morale surged.\n\nFang Yuan lightly let out a breath of air.\n\nBack then, when he created the year essence sub-pools and created time path areas, he had already prepared to use landscape as before for such a purpose.\n\nAfter using this method, the water of the River of Time in the year essence pools was almost used up, the sovereign immortal aperture’s time difference with the outside world also fell greatly.\n\nA considerable amount of time was needed, until the year essence pools could gather enough water of the River of Time to accelerate the sovereign immortal aperture’s time again.\n\nAt this point, forty percent of the sovereign immortal aperture’s foundation had just been restored.\n\nWhich meant that the sovereign immortal aperture only had forty percent in total of losses remaining, this greatly reduced the time, energy, and resources needed to reconstruct his foundation.\n\nThe forty percent of losses were created by the chaotic disaster.\n\nEven landscape as before was not useful for this. The Gu Immortals that died from the chaotic disaster were also not able to revive through Human Sea.\n\nHe had a lot of other losses as well.\n\nThe immortal essence expenditure was huge, he once had a vast amount of rank eight immortal essence, but now, he had about ten percent left, it was way below the safety margin, he was in a dangerous state.\n\nThis was also why Fang Yuan stopped and did not continue fighting against Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\nBut the good news was, as a venerable, Fang Yuan produced yellow apricot immortal essence, it was much more useful than white litchi immortal essence.\n\nThe bad news was, rank eight Immortal Gu Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus that once helped Fang Yuan greatly in terms of immortal essence storage became much less useful now.\n\nAt the same time, because the sovereign immortal aperture’s time slowed greatly, Fang Yuan’s immortal essence production speed was not high.\n\nDuring this period of time, Fang Yuan needed to rest and manage his immortal essence, he also had to refine the natural dao marks of the outside world, he would need a lot of immortal essence.\n\n“The lack of immortal essence is huge, while immortal essence stones are barely useful to me anymore.”\n\n“If I ignore everything and raise the sovereign immortal aperture’s rate of time to the limit, that will not work either!” Fang Yuan frowned slightly.\n\nVenerables faced a grand tribulation every ten years, a myriad tribulation every fifty years, and a chaotic disaster every one hundred years.\n\nUnless they were dream path, pill path and so on, grand tribulations and myriad tribulations were no threat to Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan was only wary about the chaotic disasters every one hundred years.\n\nEven though he had already gone through one chaotic disaster in Crazed Demon Cave.\n\nThat was only the Heavenly Dao blockade, it was far weaker than the chaotic disasters that would occur every one hundred years!\n\nIf the sovereign immortal aperture’s time was too fast, Fang Yuan would quickly have to face the chaotic disaster, if he got heavily injured in the process, or even near the point of death, the other venerables would take advantage of the chance.\n\nThe replenishment of immortal essence was a problem, other than this, Fang Yuan also lost a large number of Immortal Gu.\n\nIn the first parts of the Crazed Demon Cave fight, after Gu Immortals died, Fang Yuan did not retrieve their Immortal Gu or immortal apertures.\n\nIn fact, the seven Immortal Gu Houses that Fang Yuan took out in Crazed Demon Cave, including Rising Cloud City, were all lost as well.\n\nFang Yuan’s losses were so severe that no super force in the world barring Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven could afford to endure them.\n\nThankfully, in the later parts of the Crazed Demon Cave fight, Fang Yuan purposely reduced his losses in this aspect. For example, when Zhan Bu Du died, the will that he left behind sent many of his precious transformation path Immortal Gu into treasure yellow heaven.\n\nOther than Immortal Gu and immortal essence, many Gu Immortals died as well.\n\nSteel Rush Warrior, Frost Butterfly Warrior, Xiao He Jian, Ice Crystal Immortal Monarch, and even Fang Yuan’s clone Zhan Bu Du, they had all died in Crazed Demon Cave. There were also those who died in the sovereign immortal aperture when they defended against the tribulations.\n\nMost of them were revived through Human Sea, they had to re-cultivate to become immortal again.\n\nThere was also a group of them who could not be revived. Among them was the old Combat Beast King, a rank eight Gu Immortal.\n\nEven Fang Yuan felt that it was a pity.\n\nThis old man had worked laboriously without complaint, he made great contributions towards the sovereign immortal aperture. But he was killed by the black fire, Fang Yuan could not revive him.\n\nOther than these material losses, Fang Yuan also had some hidden losses.\n\nMost importantly, he exposed too many killer moves.\n\nIn the Crazed Demon Cave battle, Fang Yuan had no choice but to expose many of his compound killer moves, as well as trump cards like refine self, totem killer moves, and others.\n\nFor a long time, these killer moves could not be used, they needed to be modified.\n\nWhen he fights against the venerables in the future, if he were to use these killer moves without modification, Fang Yuan would be taking a huge risk.\n\nBut compared to his losses, Fang Yuan’s gains were much higher!\n\nIn the Crazed Demon Cave battle, Fang Yuan had immense gains, he was undeniably the biggest winner out of everyone!!\n\nFirstly, Fang Yuan ransacked the first seven layers and obtained a vast amount of chaotic dao mark immortal materials.\n\nIn the eighth layer of Crazed Demon Cave, he used Thieves Den to gain a vast amount of rank nine immortal materials. These rank nine immortal materials were enough for him to try to refine a rank nine Immortal Gu.\n\nThe second thing was Primordial Domain.\n\nFang Yuan had about the same amount of the Primordial Domain as Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, which was slightly less than Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nPrimordial Domain was extremely valuable, especially for Fang Yuan.\n\nThe third thing was Paradise Earth’s Northern Plains true inheritance, as well as his heaven path cultivation experiences. These included the method to digest truthful floating ice and raise one’s own heaven path cultivation level.\n\nThe fourth was information.\n\nAfter the battle of Crazed Demon Cave, Fang Yuan gained an in-depth understanding of Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, as well as the Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven that they belonged to!\n\nHe was no longer kept in the dark like before.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s methods, their combat systems, as well as Heavenly Court’s Door of Life and Death immortal graveyard, Transient White Cloud City Suppression painting path formation, Ruan Dan’s pill path, Longevity Heaven’s Eight Extremities formation, Calamity Luck Altar’s luck changing golden light path, and others.\n\nThe fifth gain was also Fang Yuan’s greatest gain.\n\nHis cultivation level rose to become venerable level.\n\nThis was a peak qualitative change!\n\nFrom now onwards, he went from a chess piece to a player, he could openly plot against the world and rule over the five regions.\n\nThe history of humanity and variant humans would have no choice but to remember his name.\n\nAt this point, he stood on the same plane as the ten predecessors, he was like a sun that shone throughout the ages. All other Gu Immortals, regardless of their heroism or talent, were mere stars in the sky.\n\nGu Yue Fang Yuan!\n\nThe eleventh venerable of the Gu cultivator world.\n\nA demonic cultivator who became venerable through refinement path.\n\nAccording to Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven, his title was —\n\nHeaven Refining Demon Venerable!"
