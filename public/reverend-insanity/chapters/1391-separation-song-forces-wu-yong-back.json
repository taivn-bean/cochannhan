But when facing the rank eight Gu Immortal Wu Yong, these things appeared to be superficial, they were not useful enough to serve any purpose.\n\nOnly reverse flow protection seal could be relied upon by Fang Yuan to maintain his unharmed state. Unfortunately, even this trump card could not resolve this dangerous situation.\n\nProfound immortal sound was becoming clearer and louder, Fang Yuan’s reverse flow robe was shaking while the Reverse Flow River continued to decrease in volume so fast that it was startling him.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was more anxious about Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nRed blood was flowing out of Feng Jiu Ge’s nose, mouth and eyes.\n\nHis body was shaking and it was getting more intense.\n\n“Damn it! If this goes on, Feng Jiu Ge’s killer move will be broken and will definitely backlash, causing heavy injuries, adding on Wu Yong’s attack, he might even die immediately.”\n\nFang Yuan understood this but was powerless to do anything.\n\nHe naturally was not worried about Feng Jiu Ge, but if Feng Jiu Ge died, it would be his turn to face Wu Yong.\n\nEven if air lock’s effect dissipated later on and he could use Omni-directional Travel again, he would not have the chance to do so in front of Wu Yong.\n\nHowever, just as the situation was gradually tilting in favor of Wu Yong, Feng Jiu Ge suddenly let out a breath of air, his body relaxing.\n\nSoon afterwards, a unique aura rose from his body.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge slowly opened his mouth and started singing in a weak voice.\n\nThe tone of his voice was not high, it was soft and low, but it was clearly heard by Fang Yuan and Wu Yong.\n\nHis singing gradually became slightly louder, like a low murmur or like soft sleep-talking on a quiet night.\n\nA sudden emotion rose in Wu Yong’s heart.\n\nWu Yong’s expression rapidly changed!\n\nHe had protected himself with layers of powerful immortal level defenses, but when he heard this song, these defenses actually seemed to be non-existent, letting the song evoke emotions within him.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression also changed.\n\nAlthough he did not feel anything, intense ripples were set off on the surface of the reverse flow robe.\n\nThis situation was even more serious than when he had faced the profound immortal sound’s attack!\n\n“Incredible, he possesses such a powerful sound path killer move! It targets anything and everything near it, I am also within its range, I should get away from Feng Jiu Ge.” Fang Yuan quickly retreated.\n\nHe was doing this not only for himself, but was also trying to help Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nWu Yong made the same choice and was even more thorough in his retreat, his body disappeared without a trace.\n\nBeing able to retreat or advance at will, this was the superiority of having territorial advantage.\n\nThe immortal battlefield started attacking even faster and more wildly. Profound immortal sound, clear wind blades, clear jade dripping wind and clear jade lightning, these four variation moves appeared together and covered Feng Jiu Ge in multiple layers.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge ignored them, using his body to firmly resist all the attacks, while continuing to sing.\n\nThe song was a pure and simple tune, but it contained the boundless profundities of sound path.\n\nThe song gradually became louder, it was not an instant rise, but a gradual and gentle one, alternating between low and high pitch as it rose.\n\nEmotions coiled around Wu Yong’s heart, making him even more puzzled.\n\n“What sound path killer move is this? What kind of power is this?”\n\nThe song suddenly dropped to a low pitch, an incomparable gloominess and sentimental feelings attacked Wu Yong’s heart, making him have an urge to cry!\n\nWithout any warning, a word emerged in Wu Yong’s mind — Separation.\n\nThe pain of separation, the sadness of separation, the gloominess of separation, and the reluctance of separation.\n\nSplitting up with your lover, never seeing your friends again, and the death of your loved ones.\n\nSeparated, but the past remains the same.\n\nSeparated, as old friends bid farewell.\n\nSeparated, like the setting of the sun.\n\nSeparated, like falling flowers that convey deep sadness.\n\nThe song was sometimes mournful, like it was complaining about the injustice of fate, sometimes sad, as if it was questioning the cruelty of reality, sometimes resentful, like it was screaming internally, and sometimes gloomy, like crying without tears falling out, kept deep within oneself.\n\nHuff!\n\nWu Yong’s body suddenly shook fiercely as he coughed out a large mouthful of blood.\n\nHis expression looked incredulous, because he shockingly discovered that immortal battlefield killer move, four clear transforming winds, was actually disintegrating and breaking apart!\n\nNone of the Gu worms that formed this battlefield killer move were destroyed because of the song, even the mortal Gu were intact.\n\nNaturally, some Gu worms had been destroyed when Fang Yuan had reflected the attacks with reverse flow protection seal, but Wu Yong had immediately replenished them, and there was no actual harm done.\n\nWhat made Wu Yong astonished was these Gu worms had not received the slightest of damage, but they were no longer under his control and had begun to separate from each other, not willing to cooperate and work together.\n\nThis was absurd!\n\nIf the coordination of one or two Gu worms was in chaos, it did not matter as long as they were not the cores of the killer move.\n\nIf a part of the Gu worms were destroyed, as long as they were not the cores, the killer move could still be maintained.\n\nBut now, all the Gu worms had separated and were leaving. Wu Yong was simply unable to control them.\n\nThe culprit behind this was the song from Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nSoon, Fang Yuan also sensed what had happened, he detected that the whole battlefield was in the midst of crumbling apart.\n\nFang Yuan was inwardly very surprised.\n\nWu Yong sensed the situation was awry and wanted to abort the battlefield killer move four clear transforming winds, but it was too late.\n\nAt the very next instant, the whole battlefield disintegrated, the three immortals saw the clear sky and the white clouds once again.\n\nWu Yong coughed out a mouthful of blood, he was forced out of hiding, his expression was pale as he staggered back due to the heavy injuries.\n\nAn immortal battlefield killer move was different from a Gu formation, if a Gu formation was destroyed, the Gu Immortal would usually not suffer heavy injuries, but when an immortal battlefield killer move was destroyed, the backlash would normally be heavy and severe.\n\nThe stronger a killer move was, the greater the power of the backlash.\n\nFour clear transforming winds!\n\nThis was a grand killer move that Wu clan had used to subdue Southern Border, it was terrifyingly powerful, hence when it disintegrated, the backlash on Wu Yong was extremely severe.\n\n“What an amazing killer move! What is its name?” Wu Yong gazed at Feng Jiu Ge and asked.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge did not reply him, instead he continued singing.\n\nWu Yong’s expression changed again, at this moment, he could not hold back anymore, he took out the Immortal Gu House Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building.\n\nWu Yong entered this rank eight Immortal Gu House which had powerful defenses, healing himself calmly inside it.\n\nThe matter of immortal essence expenditure was no longer the main issue.\n\nWu Yong had no choice but to do this.\n\nBut soon, the result that had shocked him occurred once again.\n\nUnder the effect of the song, Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building actually started to shake and showed a slight sign of disintegrating.\n\nThis was an actual rank eight Immortal Gu House!\n\nThis meant that Feng Jiu Ge’s killer move was at rank eight level!\n\nSeeing this, Wu Yong’s eyes shined with a terrifying light and without tending to his injuries, he directly controlled the Immortal Gu House to collide into Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nAn Immortal Gu House had no clear weakness, it was the essence of formation path. Immortal Gu Houses could rampage and destroy everything in a battlefield.\n\nThis was not just a fact from past human history, it was also tried and tested common wisdom that Fang Yuan learned in the five hundred years of his previous life.\n\nNaturally, every Immortal Gu House had its own unique power.\n\nFor instance, Hei tribe’s Dark Prison could tame ancient desolate beasts.\n\nAnother example was Thirty-three Heavenly Halls of Bai Xiang grotto-heaven, it was an Immortal Gu House with extraordinary defense and it was most proficient in storing and preserving immortal materials. But unfortunately, Thirty-three Heavenly Halls was only an incomplete Immortal Gu House; it had suffered serious damage in the past and had now already lost its movement ability.\n\nClear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building naturally had its own killer moves, but Wu Yong’s act of directly colliding into Feng Jiu Ge was also a wise choice.\n\nAfter all, activating killer moves required time.\n\nDirect collision would spend the least amount of time and was also the most straightforward.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s immortal killer move might be shockingly powerful, but he seemed to be unable to move from the spot and could only passively face attacks.\n\nThis flaw had already been noted by Fang Yuan and Wu Yong.\n\nThe defenses on Feng Jiu Ge were almost exhausted, if Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building collided into him, he would definitely turn into meat paste.\n\nAt this precarious moment, Fang Yuan could not just watch from the sidelines. When Wu Yong finished with Feng Jiu Ge, it would be his turn next.\n\nAir lock’s time limit had not been reached yet, Fang Yuan moved forward and blocked the path of Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building.\n\nFang Yuan could not activate strength path giant hand, most of his attention was on maintaining reverse flow protection seal, he was only able to transform his arms and hands into dragon arms and claws, cover them with dragon scales, then activate rank seven dragon strength Immortal Gu.\n\nThese Immortal Gu were all ‘borrowed’ from Wu clan, and now they were being used against Wu Yong.\n\nWu Yong felt his chest tightening at this sight, and intensely poured in his immortal essence into the Immortal Gu House.\n\nBoom!\n\nBoth sides collided, and without any surprise, Fang Yuan was sent flying.\n\nHis strength was inferior to Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building, he was like a cannonball that was shot far away.\n\nBut he suffered no injuries because of reverse flow protection seal.\n\nOn the contrary, Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building lost many mortal Gu from the collision.\n\nWith this opening created, Feng Jiu Ge’s song became even more effective.\n\nWu Yong seized the chance, continuing to control the Immortal Gu House to collide into Feng Jiu Ge, while at the same time, he began to concentrate on activating a killer move of Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building.\n\nThe Immortal Gu House was about to collide into Feng Jiu Ge, but Fang Yuan could not return in time.\n\nHowever, right at this moment, Feng Jiu Ge suddenly moved and flew to the sky.\n\nWu Yong’s attack missed, his expression immediately showed shock and fury. Feng Jiu Ge could clearly move since the start, and had intentionally done this to deceive the enemy!\n\nThe song was still continuing, Immortal Gu House Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building was disintegrating.\n\nFrom the surface, it looked like a two-storied bamboo stilt building. Although it was a rank eight Immortal Gu House, it used few Gu worms. It was not like those Immortal Gu Houses which were huge, they had a large number of Gu worms.\n\nWith only so few Gu worms, Feng Jiu Ge’s song was clearly even more effective.\n\nFirst, bamboos began to separate, the bamboos on the edges even directly left the Immortal Gu House.\n\nThese bamboos were naturally not real bamboos, soon after leaving the main body, they emitted bright jade radiance as they disintegrated into countless little Gu worms.\n\nWu Yong’s expression turned gloomy.\n\nThe situation was extremely unfavorable to him!\n\nAt this time, Fang Yuan neared once again.\n\nWu Yong coldly snorted, gazing deeply at Fang Yuan and Feng Jiu Ge before he mobilized Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building to leave.\n\nIn just a few moments, Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building left the battlefield, becoming a small black dot in the horizon.\n\nHe had actually taken the initiative to retreat!"
