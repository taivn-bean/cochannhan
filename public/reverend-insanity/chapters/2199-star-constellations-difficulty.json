  "content": "Chapter 2199: Star Constellation’s Difficulty\n\nAll kinds of killer moves and methods were activated endlessly by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\nSome killer moves were domineering, spanning across heaven and earth. Some methods were exquisite and dazzling, splitting the universe.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun was like a golden meteor, charging forward bravely.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s body flickered as she moved around in Star Constellation Chessboard Formation, leaving behind starlight shadows that attacked Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\nMoreover, even when fighting, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was still controlling Star Constellation Chessboard Formation to help Heavenly Court members.\n\nPrince Feng Xian used phoenix flames, Bai Cang Shui let out a large blue river, flower petals rained down below Wan Zi Hong… All kinds of killer moves were used repeatedly, and under Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s support, the conflicts between them were greatly reduced, forming waves of attacks that followed one after the other with short gaps between each other. Lu Wei Yin and others got a feeling of Heavenly Court’s attacks being continuous and unending.\n\nFang Yuan frowned, commenting in his mind: “Star Constellation Immortal Venerable has astonishing wisdom path attainment, even though Immortal Zombie Giant Sun is fighting her, he is not able to force out her limits. She still has the energy to support others and control the whole battlefield.”\n\n“So, from another angle, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun also hasn’t used his full strength?”\n\nThe two venerables were fighting, although there were huge explosions and countless methods used, their power did not go beyond Qi Sea Ancestor’s Hu elevation killer move.\n\nBe they Star Constellation Immortal Venerable or Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, they were wary of triggering Limitless’ countermeasures.\n\nA venerable’s foundation was unfathomable, if any one side were to trigger Limitless’ countermeasures, the other side would gain an advantage.\n\nNaturally, the important thing was that both venerables wanted to obtain the eternal life research results!\n\nThe value of this research was enormous to the point of being inestimable.\n\nIn the deadlock between venerables, if a venerable could obtain the eternal life research results, they could likely break the balance and become the strongest among the venerables!\n\nEven Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun were coveting the eternal life research results, so they had to restrain themselves right now. If they destroyed this formation in the midst of the intense battle, that would be a huge problem.\n\nThey were not Limitless, these truthful floating ice pieces were nurtured for over a million years. If any one of them was destroyed, the venerables would not be able to substitute it.\n\n“Since it is so….” Fang Yuan’s eyes shined brightly for a while, he suddenly commanded, “Qi Sea!”\n\nQi Sea Ancestor received the main body’s voice transmission, he immediately used a killer move without hesitation.\n\nImmortal killer move — Hu Elevation!\n\nThe terrifying qi path killer move descended once again.\n\nThe immortals evaded immediately.\n\nEven the allied group of Qi Jue and Lu Wei Yin was the same.\n\n“Are you insane?’\n\n“Aren’t you afraid of triggering Limitless’ retaliation again?”\n\n“No, maybe this is Fang Yuan’s intention. Truly… amazing!”\n\nThe Gu Immortals were bewildered for a while before coming to a realization.\n\nLu Wei Yin’s group was joyous, while the Heavenly Court Gu Immortals were worried.\n\nSure enough, at the next moment, chains appeared from thin air and bound Qi Sea Ancestor.\n\nBut the thing was, Qi Sea Ancestor was currently on Star Constellation Chessboard Formation.\n\nLimitless’ countermeasures attacked Qi Sea, they naturally would not leave Star Constellation Chessboard Formation out.\n\nFang Yuan wanted to get the help of Limitless’ countermeasures to break Star Constellation Chessboard Formation!\n\nBut at the next moment.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable suddenly got away from Immortal Zombie Giant Sun: “Fang Yuan, your scheme is wonderful, but how could I have not prepared for such a huge flaw? Please take a look.”\n\nThe moment her words landed, starlight bloomed, many of the horizontal and vertical starry paths moved and attached on Limitless’ chains.\n\nAfter a few breaths of time, Limitless’ chains were bound by starry paths and were under Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s control now.\n\nStar Constellation Chessboard Formation was not disturbed by Limitless’ countermeasures, instead, it made use of them. The strength of these chains were used to make Star Constellation Chessboard Formation even firmer.\n\n“How could this be?!” Demon Immortal Qi Jue’s expression changed.\n\nLu Wei Yin said through gritted teeth: “Star Constellation Immortal Venerable has prepared too well, her infiltration of Crazed Demon Cave is too deep.”\n\nThis was not strange.\n\nAfter all, when Crazed Demon Cave was just constructed, Limitless Demon Venerable attacked Heavenly Court and made a bet with Star Constellation’s will.\n\nThat was to say, Heavenly Court had begun infiltrating Crazed Demon Cave the moment it was established.\n\nThis infiltration lasted over a million years!\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun obtained Savage Wilderness Great World, his infiltration of Crazed Demon Cave was about three hundred thousand years or so, it was not even half the time of Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s infiltration.\n\nMoreover, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable cultivated wisdom path, which excelled in infiltrating.\n\nAnd Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s Yellow Earth Great World was only established over a hundred thousand years ago.\n\nAs for Fang Yuan, he was the most miserable one.\n\nAlthough he came in touch with Crazed Demon Cave about ten or so years ago, his infiltration time of the Crazed Demon formation was almost zero.\n\nIf the Door of Life and Death was Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s home ground. Then Crazed Demon Cave was over fifty percent the home ground of Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, while Immortal Zombie Giant Sun only had less than half the home ground advantage. Fang Yuan was like a guest, his understanding of Crazed Demon Cave mostly came from Paradise Earth’s information.\n\nStar Constellation Chessboard gained Limitless’ chains, becoming even more powerful.\n\nHeavenly Court Gu Immortals were unafraid of death, they used their lives to tie down the pseudo venerable opponents.\n\nAfter all, an Immortal Venerable was helping them.\n\nNaturally, they could not obstruct Fang Yuan’s main body!\n\nFang Yuan’s main body moved towards the sky and joined Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s battle.\n\nAs for Qi Sea Ancestor, he was bound by the chains. He could not even be put back into the sovereign immortal aperture, and could only leave his protection to Zhan Bu Du and others.\n\n“Then, let’s try this move.” Fang Yuan took a deep breath, his gaze shining brightly.\n\nImmortal killer move — Five Restriction Profound Light Qi!\n\nFive colored light qi rapidly spread from around Fang Yuan. Be they Heavenly Court Gu Immortals or Lu Wei Yin’s group, they all retreated.\n\nThey would suffer backlash every moment they fought in this five restriction profound light qi.\n\nFive regional walls were manifesting once again through Fang Yuan’s hands!\n\n“This move again!” Prince Feng Xian and others gritted their teeth.\n\nThis move came from Tao Zhu, it had repeatedly made things difficult for Heavenly Court during the fate war and in Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space.\n\nRight now, it became Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s issue!\n\nFive restriction profound light qi was spreading in Star Constellation Chessboard Formation, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable immediately felt its effects as she started suffering backlash.\n\nThose chains of Limitless on starry paths began to shake, eager to take action.\n\n“Five restriction profound light qi is suppressed in this formation. But it looks like Star Constellation Immortal Venerable has not been able to find a way to break it.”\n\n“However… this method will trigger Limitless’ countermeasures.”\n\nFang Yuan observed carefully.\n\nIt was not strange for it to trigger Limitless’ countermeasures. Five restriction profound light qi was the nemesis of Gu formations and Immortal Gu Houses, the Crazed Demon formation was also restrained. Inside five restriction profound light qi, the Crazed Demon formation would also suffer backlash, breaking apart eventually.\n\nLimitless’ arrangements would naturally detect this threat, so it was normal for five restriction profound light qi to trigger the countermeasures.\n\nThis was why Fang Yuan did not use five restriction profound light qi earlier.\n\nAs for the Door of Life and Death, there were too many soul path dao marks, even five restriction profound light qi would be suppressed. Moreover, even if the light qi became dense and formed five regional walls, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun and the rest would also be endangered, it was not worth it.\n\nBut the current situation was different.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s methods were amazing, she actually used Star Constellation Chessboard Formation to forcibly merge Limitless’ chains. At this stage, Fang Yuan suddenly used five restriction profound light qi to oppose it!\n\nIn an instant, the amount of things Star Constellation Immortal Venerable needed to calculate increased by over ten times.\n\nShe had to deal with Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, help Heavenly Court members fight the pseudo venerables, forcibly control Limitless’ chains, and also accelerate the Crazed Demon formation to quickly produce eternal life research results.\n\nNow, Fang Yuan activated five restriction profound light qi in Star Constellation Chessboard Formation, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had to endure the backlash as well as suppress Limitless’ chains.\n\nFang Yuan’s five restriction profound light qi was of extreme threat to the Crazed Demon formation, Limitless’ chains were doing everything they could to shackle him. But Star Constellation Immortal Venerable must suppress it, if she did not suppress it and let it take effect freely, it would severely interfere and ultimately destroy Star Constellation Chessboard Formation.\n\nOnce the formation was destroyed, just these Heavenly Court Gu Immortals, even if they had the immortal graveyard, could not block the bloodthirsty pseudo venerables.\n\nAt that time, even if Star Constellation Immortal Venerable blocked Immortal Zombie Giant Sun and Fang Yuan, she would not be able to guard the eternal life research results, and the pseudo venerables would gain them.\n\nThere were no two ways about it, Heavenly Court had too little manpower after all.\n\nEven though Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had revived, her enemies were too numerous!\n\n“Five restriction profound light qi, what an amazing move!” Shen Shang praised as he saw through the situation.\n\nEven he felt bad for Star Constellation Immortal Venerable!"
