Back when Fang Yuan was undergoing tribulation while rank six, he had fought with Fang Yuan.\n\nWho could have thought that in just a few years, Fang Yuan had already become a person whom he had to look up to!\n\n“Counting the first time I used myriad ghost sword dragon, this time’s myriad sword ghost dragon usage as well as myriad fusion ghost dragon sword, about ten thousand of my soul path dao marks have been expended!”\n\nFang Yuan analyzed in his head.\n\nMyriad ghost sword dragon was powerful, but it permanently expended Fang Yuan’s soul path dao marks.\n\nOne activation of myriad ghost sword dragon expended four thousand soul path dao marks. After killing Li Huang, Fang Yuan’s soul path dao marks had been shaved off by ten thousand.\n\nNaturally, Fang Yuan did not have so many soul path dao marks yet, he was substituting them with transformation path dao marks.\n\nIn short, myriad fusion ghost dragon sword was a powerful move that could kill Li Huang who possessed verdant sun flame cloak, but the cost was extremely high as well.\n\nThe significance of dao marks was obvious to a Gu Immortal.\n\nPermanently expending dao marks was directly reducing one’s foundation, it could not be used easily unless absolutely necessary.\n\nMoreover, this move had a flaw, the soul sword’s speed was not outstanding and could be dodged easily.\n\nFang Yuan knew that Li Huang was protecting Hairy Foot Mountain and could not casually dodge the attack, so he used this move.\n\n“Hairy Foot Mountain…”\n\nLooking at Hairy Foot Mountain that was getting closer in his vision, Fang Yuan gave a moved sigh.\n\nWho could have thought the majestic and renowned Infallible blessed land would be on Hairy Foot Mountain. From the outside, this mountain was extremely ordinary, it was like an inconspicuous hill.\n\nBut in truth, it was one of the most important areas to Heavenly Court in order to repair fate Gu, and now had become an area to determine victory or defeat in this arduous battle.\n\n“Fang Yuan!!” At the next moment, another figure appeared and blocked Fang Yuan’s path.\n\nIt was Chen Yi!\n\n“Wu Yong did not kill you, then let me end your life instead.” Fang Yuan called out as he prepared myriad fusion ghost dragon sword once again.\n\nChen Yi’s face turned solemn.\n\nEven Li Huang had perished, he did not have any confidence in facing myriad fusion ghost dragon sword.\n\n“Hmm? This is!” At the crucial moment, Chen Yi suddenly felt his chest burning as if a hot iron was pressed on his flesh.\n\nA powerful and mysterious force circulated and permeated his body.\n\nFollowing the surging of this strength, Chen Yi’s clothes were ripped apart, revealing his chest.\n\nThere was a painting on his chest, the painting of a tall tree wavering in the wind!\n\n“Ahhh!” Chen Yi cried out in shock: “Isn’t this painting the one which was engraved on my body when I inherited Genesis Lotus’ true inheritance many years ago?”\n\nAt the same time, information was directly transmitted to his mind.\n\n“This is Lord Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable’s arrangement!”\n\nChen Yi was surprised and happy, he quickly activated the strongest ability according to this information.\n\nImmortal killer move — Karma Divine Tree!\n\nImmediately, green smoke rose from Chen Yi’s body.\n\nThe smoke gathered six feet above his head, gradually slowing down to a stop and circulating within itself, forming into the shape of a tree.\n\nThe tree was thick and sturdy with dense amounts of branches and lush leaves, and there were dozens of fruits hanging on it. But these fruits were very weird, they were in all kinds of shapes, colors and sizes. Some were like black peaches, some were pink but large like a basin, some had spikes on them, some had transparent skin, the flesh and core could be seen from the outside.\n\nKarma divine tree formed quickly and the power within the painting transferred to karma divine tree.\n\nChen Yi seemed to have heard Genesis Lotus Immortal Venerable’s voice: “Look closely, this is the consecutive move built upon karma divine tree — Karma Relocation!”\n\nThe killer move activated, as if intense winds were blowing, the green smoke flickered as karma divine tree started to sway and dance in the wind.\n\nMyriad fusion ghost dragon sword attacked like a meteoric thunderbolt.\n\nBut just when it neared karma divine tree, with a whoosh, myriad fusion ghost dragon sword suddenly disappeared.\n\n“What?!” Fang Yuan was shocked.\n\nAt that instant, he sensed that his connection to his killer move myriad fusion ghost dragon sword became negligible, as if myriad fusion ghost dragon sword was suddenly worlds apart from him!\n\n“What method is this? It seems like instant transportation?” Fang Yuan immediately narrowed his eyes as sharp light flashed past them.\n\nThe connection between immortal killer moves and Gu Immortals had a certain limit in range. When it surpassed this limit, the immortal killer move would usually break apart.\n\nFang Yuan’s myriad fusion ghost dragon sword was based on the killer move myriad ghost sword dragon and carried the trait of enslavement path, thus he could still maintain a trace of connection even if it was teleported over ten thousand li away.\n\nBut this connection was extremely faint, if it surpassed this distance even a little, the killer move would collapse by itself.\n\nIf that happened, Fang Yuan would suffer the backlash of killer move failure.\n\nMyriad fusion ghost dragon sword was so powerful, its backlash absolutely would not be weak and would definitely make him cough out blood.\n\n“It can forcibly teleport killer moves?” Wu Yong obtained the information from Fang Yuan: “Then let me see how you deal with my farewell friend wind.”\n\nWu Yong sneered.\n\nHis figure appeared behind Chen Yi.\n\nImmortal killer move — Farewell Friend Wind!\n\nBut Wu Yong had just touched Chen Yi’s shoulder when his vision changed.\n\nIn an instant, he was teleported away from Infallible blessed land, returning to Southern Border.\n\n“This?!” Wu Yong was dumbfounded as he stood at the peak of the mountain.\n\nSoon afterwards, he came to his senses, his face was extremely dark as he quickly sent the information.\n\n“Even rank eight Gu Immortals can be forcibly sent away?!”\n\n“What killer move is this?”\n\n“Karma divine tree still had such a mysterious ability?”\n\nThe Southern Border and Northern Plains immortals were shaken while Central Continent’s morale rose again.\n\n“We will continue defending like this!” Chen Yi was exulted but Fang Yuan’s voice made him solemn once more.\n\nFang Yuan shouted: “I found it! His teleportation ability seems to be unstoppable but there is a limit in the amount of times he can use it. Because after using it twice, two fruits were consumed!”\n\n“It was discovered so quickly?” Chen Yi smiled bitterly.\n\n“Let me try!” Heavenly Lord Bai Zu flew over, his body shook slightly as he split into countless clones and charged forward like a giant wave.\n\nThis was a classic enslavement path battle tactic, a battle of attrition style.\n\nKarma divine tree swayed with the wind, a fruit suddenly disappeared.\n\nHeavenly Lord Bai Zu’s main body disappeared, Fang Yuan’s group received his message shortly afterwards — he was teleported to Eastern Sea!\n\nThe immortals were in a clamor.\n\nFang Yuan sank into deep thought: ‘This time, Heavenly Lord Bai Zu’s main body was directly teleported away, the enslavement path battle tactic has failed. According to conventional reasoning, shouldn’t it be teleporting each clone? It actually directly affected the main body?!”\n\nThis time, Yao Huang’s group charged over.\n\n“Slow down, Brother Chu, you guys attack first.” Fang Yuan instructed.\n\nChu Du attacked, he used a long range attack on Chen Yi but he quickly disappeared on the spot.\n\nHe was teleported back to Northern Plains, ending up in the northern icy plain.\n\nMoreover because the distance was too long, he lost connection with the killer move he used, the killer move broke apart and he suffered the backlash.\n\nSeveral people attacked next but they were all teleported away.\n\nFang Yuan suddenly came to a realization: “It seems that my main body is not influenced by this killer move because I am a complete otherworldly demon?”\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan started a fierce wave of offense.\n\nHowever, karma divine tree might be unable to influence him but it could affect his killer moves.\n\nFang Yuan’s methods were all teleported away, the range was either far or short, some were teleported to some place in Central Continent, some were sent to other four regions, and some were even teleported to black heaven and white heaven.\n\nNaturally, Chen Yi also did not have a good time.\n\nIt did not take long before he began to bleed from his seven orifices and his face was getting increasingly pale.\n\nThe burden to sustain such a wondrous killer move was clearly huge.\n\n“Damn it, Hairy Foot Mountain is clearly in front of us, but because of Chen Yi alone…” Yao Huang clenched his teeth in helplessness.\n\nQing Ye and the rest quickly arrived and fought against the Northern Plains and Southern Border immortals.\n\nFang Yuan dodged the attack of Wind Sweeping Building and sent many myriad ghost sword dragons to attack Chen Yi.\n\nKarma divine tree was constantly shaking, countless myriad ghost sword dragons disappeared, teleported to random locations.\n\nIt was okay for those that were teleported nearby, but those that were teleported far away broke apart immediately, inflicting backlash on Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan felt that this situation was troublesome!\n\n“Weak killer moves cannot expend karma divine tree’s fruits even if they are teleported away. A strong killer move can expend one fruit but if it is teleported beyond the distance I can control, I will have to endure the backlash and might even be heavily injured if I am unlucky.”\n\nFang Yuan did not dare to use myriad fusion ghost dragon sword.\n\nHe currently did not have winter coat or reverse flow protection seal to rely on, his defensive methods were weaker than Li Huang’s. If myriad fusion ghost dragon sword failed, he would be in great trouble from the backlash.\n\nFang Yuan’s luck was quite good as the previous myriad fusion ghost dragon sword did not inflict backlash on him.\n\n“What do I do now?” Fang Yuan was anxious.\n\nBing Sai Chuan had been transmitting the situation in Heavenly Court to him, Fang Yuan knew that the repair of fate Gu had started again.\n\n“This is a wood path method, I don’t have much attainment in this path and won’t be able to decipher it within a short period of time.”\n\n“Looks like I can only use a crude method, we will compete in a battle of attrition! Bai Ning Bing, you all can go ahead and fight now!”\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined sharply as he sent the command resolutely.\n\nBai Ning Bing and other rank seven Gu Immortals charged towards Hairy Foot Mountain.\n\nKarma divine tree activated, every time it teleported a rank seven Gu Immortal, a fruit was expended.\n\n“Fang Yuan actually found the best countermeasure so quickly.” Chen Yi felt anxious, his eyes were filled with blood and he was in a very weak condition.\n\nA large number of rank seven Gu Immortals were teleported away, finally, karma divine tree’s fruits were all spent.\n\nKarma divine tree without any fruits faded away with the wind.\n\nChen Yi lowered his head, his aura had fallen to an extreme point of weakness.\n\n“You dare to block my way, die!” Fang Yuan charged fiercely."
