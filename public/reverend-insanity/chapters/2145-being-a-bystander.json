Let’s go and report to the elders. Move!”\n\nUnder everyone’s gaze, Meng Qiu Zhen went with the flow and entered Tu clan village with the bald youngster, Huang Xiao Mi, and the rest.\n\nOn the way, the bald youngster reminded Meng Qiu Zhen softly: “Sister Fang, you need to report properly, otherwise you might be implicated as well. Variant humans like this mushroomman are vicious things, he is already sure to die!”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen did not respond.\n\nThe tied Huang Xiao Mi shouted: “That’s right, I deceived Fang Tu and threatened her. You are creating a huge trouble for your Tu clan by capturing me! Someone will definitely come to save me.”\n\nHuang Xiao Mi was saved by Fang Tu, he clearly did not want to implicate his benefactor, thus saying this intentionally.\n\nThe bald youngster led Huang Xiao Mi to Tu clan village’s prison, and received praises from Tu clan village’s elders.\n\nAfter everyone left, the bald youngster invited Meng Qiu Zhen to his home: “It is already late, Sister Fang, come to my home to have dinner and stay for the night. Back when we were neighbors, we used to play together. My mother will also be very happy if she sees you!”\n\n“So this ‘Green Beast’ had this kind of relationship with Fang Tu?” Meng Qiu Zhen nodded and let the plot develop.\n\nSoon, Meng Qiu Zhen followed the bald youngster to his home.\n\nThis was an ordinary two-storied bamboo building.\n\nOnly the bald youngster and his mother lived here.\n\nThe bald youngster opened the door to the kitchen and said loudly: “Mother, look who I brought?”\n\n“Ahh, Little Fang. I haven’t seen you for many days. Are your parents okay?” The bald youngster’s mother was very enthusiastic.\n\n“They are both fine, thank you, auntie.” Meng Qiu Zhen said half-heartedly.\n\nThe bald youngster’s mother nodded, smiling: “Little Fang is here as a guest, take a seat, I will prepare some dishes.”\n\nThe bald youngster said impatiently: “Mother, you should prepare more delicious food. This meal will be your son’s celebration feast as well.”\n\n“You brat, what have you done this time?” The bald youngster’s mother frowned.\n\nThe bald youngster patted his chest: “Mother, your son made a huge contribution this time! I arrested a mushroomman and locked him in prison.”\n\n“What?” The bald youngster’s mother paused.\n\nThe bald youngster quickly narrated the event.\n\nThe bald youngster’s mother frowned as she looked at Meng Qiu Zhen: “Little Fang, this brat likes to talk nonsense, is what he said true?”\n\n“Yes.” Meng Qiu Zhen nodded before adding: “But big brother Huang Xiao Mi is a good person. I…”\n\nBefore he finished speaking, he was once again interrupted by the bald youngster: “Alright, Sister Fang, I have warned you several times. You can say this at home, but don’t talk about it outside.”\n\n“Okay, okay.” The bald youngster’s mother waved her hand, “Brat, there is no more soy sauce left. Go to the nearby shop and get some soy sauce.”\n\n“Ah?”\n\n“Hurry up and go, how can I make food without soy sauce?”\n\n“Oh, alright, alright.”\n\nAfter the bald youngster left, his mother walked towards Meng Qiu Zhen: “Come, Little Fang, tell auntie what is going on?”\n\nThe dream realm’s third stage passed like this.\n\nFourth stage.\n\nDeep in the night, underground prison.\n\n“My identity changed again?” When Meng Qiu Zhen came to his senses, he immediately realized this.\n\nHe had left the mortal Fang Tu’s identity and become a Gu Master again; moreover, his cultivation was rank four!\n\n“I am actually the bald youngster’s mother now?” Meng Qiu Zhen shortly discovered that the bald youngster’s mother was actually a mushroomman.\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen immediately had a guess: “My current identity is probably that Huang Wan.”\n\nThis dream realm originated from Paradise Earth, what was special about it was the identities in the different stages of the dream realm were not fixed.\n\n“I might even play the role of Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable in the next dream realm.” Meng Qiu Zhen smiled.\n\nTill now, he had not seen even the shadow of Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable.\n\nIn the first stage of the dream realm, Meng Qiu Zhen learned that Huang Xiao Mi’s mushroomman tribe had a former witch – Huang Wan. She had great strength and was the only doctor that might be able to cure the plague.\n\nHowever, he knew from the old granny that this former witch Huang Wan was expelled from the tribe for some reason.\n\n“This mushroomman Huang Wan concealed her identity and lived in Tu clan village, a human territory. She even adopted a human child to perfectly conceal her identity. If that bald youngster knew his ‘mother’ was actually a mushroomman, I wonder what expression he would show?”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen laughed.\n\nHe used a very short period of time to get familiar with the Gu worms on him.\n\nThe Gu worms were comprehensive, covering attack, defense, movement, healing, and other aspects. Meng Qiu Zhen intuitively sensed some of these Gu worms could combine to form a mortal killer move.\n\nUnfortunately, the situation now did not allow Meng Qiu Zhen to test the killer move or its possible combination.\n\n“The third stage already gave obvious clues. Although this mushroomman Huang Wan was expelled from the tribe, her heart is with the tribe. She immediately moved during the night to save Huang Xiao Mi.”\n\n“I must move quickly!”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen immediately went deeper into the underground prison.\n\nThe structure of the underground prison was simple and clear.\n\nVery soon, he saw Huang Xiao Mi, who was tied to the wall in the deepest part of the prison.\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen used his Gu worms, silently melting the lock on the prison door.\n\n“Huang Xiao Mi, wake up.” Meng Qiu Zhen walked towards Huang Xiao Mi and was about to inspect his condition.\n\nSuddenly, ‘Huang Xiao Mi’ detonated, turning into ash that covered Meng Qiu Zhen.\n\nShortly after, alarm bells rang and guards started shouting.\n\nThe whole prison started emitting dark-yellow light. The concealed Gu formation was activated.\n\n“Oh no, it is a trap!” Meng Qiu Zhen helplessly discovered that ‘Huang Xiao Mi’ had completely disappeared.\n\nHe hurriedly retreated, using poison Gu to corrode the Gu formation but it showed little effect.\n\n“Such guts! Breaking into my Tu clan’s jail!”\n\n“It is indeed like that captive said, someone came to save him. Hmph! Surrender quietly and we might spare your life!”\n\nTwo elders with similar faces like they were twins were transported by the Gu formation and arrived in front of Meng Qiu Zhen.\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen sneered as he started the fight.\n\nThe battle lasted for sixty rounds before he was defeated and captured by the two elders.\n\nThe dream realm dissipated.\n\n“I failed.” Meng Qiu Zhen’s soul returned to his body as he sighed.\n\nParadise Earth’s dream realm was not easy to explore, but Meng Qiu Zhen had plenty of experience, he reached the fourth stage before failing.\n\nHis soul was quite injured, Meng Qiu Zhen began to think about the events while healing his soul.\n\n“Those two elders are really strong! They both have rank four cultivation, and they have extremely good teamwork when fighting, like they are one person.”\n\n“Not only do I have to fight those two elders, I also have to deal with the Gu formation. It is quite straining.”\n\n“Naturally, there is another important reason, I am not familiar with poison path Gu worms. I should use this time to deduce the hidden poison path killer moves.”\n\n“Hmm, there is another reason as well…”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen reflected on himself and realized he had been fretful in the dream realm.\n\nAlthough that fake Huang Xiao Mi deceived his initial detection methods, if he was in his normal mental state, he would not have rashly entered the prison, and would have used Gu worms to inspect the situation once again.\n\n“At that time, Huang Wan’s mood was extremely anxious and I was unknowingly affected by it, clouding my judgment.”\n\nThere were emotional disturbances in the previous three stages as well, but they were all suppressed by Meng Qiu Zhen.\n\nAt the fourth stage, the dream realm’s emotions would naturally be deeper than the third stage.\n\nThis was also one of the difficulties of exploring dream realms.\n\nUsing this time, Meng Qiu Zhen deduced five poison path killer moves which were mostly based on bee poison Gu.\n\nEntering the dream realm again, Meng Qiu Zhen inspected patiently this time.\n\nHe made an astonishing discovery: Not only was Huang Xiao Mi fake, the whole underground prison was also fake.\n\n“This is a fake prison, the real prison is still below. The Gu formation’s main body is also below!”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen carefully entered the real underground prison.\n\nTu clan village’s real underground prison was unexpectedly complicated and extensive!\n\nThe underground prison was like an ant nest, it was filled with thousands of paths intersecting each other, Meng Qiu Zhen felt like he had entered a maze.\n\n“The whole mountain seems to have been dug and made into a prison.”\n\n“This Tu clan village is clearly an ordinary force, but it was actually able to do this?”\n\n“No, there is a trace of Earth Tunnel here!”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen was probing carefully and soon discovered traces of one of the ten earths, Earth Tunnel.\n\n“This mountain must be of famous mountain level, it contains a natural Earth Tunnel. Tu clan village just slightly developed the Earth Tunnel and was able to gain a large amount of resources. No wonder they were able to nurture two rank four elders.”\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen was moving everywhere in the prison.\n\nThe underground prison was mostly empty, and there were more beasts than mortals locked up in it.\n\nMeng Qiu Zhen was still unable to find any clues even after some time. The dream realm had exhausted a large amount of his soul foundation by now.\n\n“Those two Gu Masters!” Meng Qiu Zhen suddenly heard the sounds of Gu cultivators traveling through the Earth Tunnel from ahead.\n\nHe quickly moved aside and hid.\n\nSwish, swish.\n\nThe two Gu Masters slipped out from the Earth Tunnel.\n\n“The two rank four elders.” Meng Qiu Zhen was observing secretly, and immediately recognized them.\n\nThey were all along in the underground prison, so they were able to reach the fake prison immediately in the previous situation.\n\nThe two elders talked while moving.\n\n“This mushroomman is quite tight-lipped, he actually endured such cruel torture!”\n\n“Even if he does not say it, we are already aware that a mushroomman tribe has been hiding in the surroundings of Tu clan village. It is just that we don’t know the specific location.”\n\n“Right, we must obtain the specific location of the mushroomman tribe from this captive and eliminate them!”\n\n“In a few days, we will be able to remove the defensive methods on his soul. At that time, we will know everything by searching his soul.”\n\n\\[0\\] The title is literally translated as buying soy sauce."
