But the trump card unlimited qi sea killer move was still quite foreign to Fang Yuan.\n\nOther than training killer moves, Fang Yuan’s main body also patrolled immemorial white heaven and used both spontaneous auspicious cloud and heaven form to attempt to find more grotto-heavens.\n\nBut until now, Fang Yuan had found nothing.\n\n“Even though heaven form has a wide range, against this huge immemorial white heaven, it is just too tiny in comparison.”\n\n“But along this route, I had great gains, I obtained a lot of rank eight immortal materials.”\n\n“This is truly the best route for me, I was lucky all along the way, it was filled with surprises!”\n\n“Oh? My time path clone has obtained results from deduction?”\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined with bright light.\n\nHis main body cultivated diligently but had no great gains, but after so much time spent on deductions, the time path clone obtained quite a good result.\n\n“Another Immortal Gu House’s deduction is completed! Very good!”\n\nFang Yuan was overjoyed, he diverted some of his attention to his immortal aperture as he started assembling it.\n\nImmemorial white heaven was very dangerous with countless immemorial desolate beasts roaming around, there were even immemorial desolate beast groups occasionally. If ordinary rank eight Gu Immortals explored this place they would need to be vigilant. Some rank seven experts would also explore immemorial white heaven for cultivation resources occasionally, but they were all fearful and careful.\n\nHowever, Fang Yuan had spontaneous auspicious cloud, he only had good luck along the way. With the help of heaven form, he could detect any danger in advance, Fang Yuan was able to easily avoid them ahead of time.\n\nIron wall Gu.\n\nThis was a rank six metal path Gu worm, it was the size of an adult’s fist, heavy and resembling a rhinoceros beetle, but be it the head or back, it was squarish and straight, its body had almost no curves at all.\n\nEvidently, iron wall Gu was a defensive Gu worm, it had been taken from Lang Ya Sect’s inventory, used by Fang Yuan now to create his second Immortal Gu House.\n\nOnce iron wall Gu was activated, a large number of mortal Gu followed.\n\nThese mortal Gu were of various types, there were three thousand of them, among which fire path and metal path were the most numerous, they were all rank five Gu.\n\nIron wall Gu was fixed at the center while the mortal Gu surrounded it as they moved like a wave.\n\nA wave of black light appeared among the mortal Gu like spreading ink, it enveloped all of the Gu worms as a black ball of light was created.\n\nThe black ball floated in the sky, its surface was uneven as the Gu worms inside started to fly even faster now.\n\nAfter reaching a certain speed, the black ball became extremely smooth, there were no bumps anymore, it was completely round.\n\nAt this point, Fang Yuan started to activate his fire path Immortal Gu.\n\nHe activated three fire path Immortal Gu and a large number of mortal Gu, creating a flame.\n\nThe flame had an intense scarlet color, coiling around the black ball as it burned continuously.\n\nAn alluring fragrance started to spread, mortals who breathed it in would indulge in it and feel deep desires and imaginations that could not be stopped.\n\nAfter burning for many hours, the black ball turned into a golden ball of light on the surface, the black color earlier seemed to be soot that was removed by the flames.\n\nFang Yuan maintained this golden ball of light as he stopped the flame, taking out water path and wisdom path Immortal Gu as he created a clear spring.\n\nThe spring water doused the golden ball as sizzling sounds were heard, it was like red-hot iron submerged in water.\n\nBut no steam was produced, all of the water had fused into the golden ball.\n\nThe golden ball of light started to become slower in rotation, the Gu worms inside looked like tiny golden meteors that spun around endlessly.\n\nThe pattern of their traces became more complicated and disorganized, it would make people feel dizzy when looking, but no collisions had taken place at all during this period.\n\nAt this time, Fang Yuan took out his second supplementary Immortal Gu.\n\nFood path Immortal Gu — Cook.\n\nIt looked like a giant water bug that was the size of a basin. It had a triangular head and short feelers, under its feelers were two compound eyes shining in golden light.\n\nIts body was flat and oval shaped, it was dark-red in color and had the sensation of touching sand, it was very warm.\n\nIt had three pairs of legs, the front pair was the strongest, looking like two thick and powerful pincers.\n\nImmortal Gu Cook was obtained by Fang Yuan when he extorted the Southern Border righteous path.\n\nBy now, Fang Yuan had already returned the bodies and souls of the Southern Border Gu Immortal captives, he started to exchange Immortal Gu with them.\n\nFang Yuan spent an hour before he placed Immortal Gu Cook into the golden ball of light.\n\nThe golden ball expanded by double its original size as a result.\n\nFang Yuan was already covered in sweat, he had finally gotten past this hardest part of the first step.\n\nAssembling an Immortal Gu House was not easy, it was much more difficult than using normal killer moves. If it failed, the Gu Immortal would face a backlash, the Gu worms used would also be damaged or destroyed.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan was extremely careful and vigilant.\n\nAs he continued, Fang Yuan added Dog Shit Luck, Qi Luck, Luck Inspection, Connect Luck, Time Luck, and his other luck path Immortal Gu into the ball.\n\nHis luck path attainment level was master, while formation path was grandmaster, he already had intuition.\n\nThus, during the process of assembling it, if any bad feelings emerged, Fang Yuan would pay close attention to them and make appropriate adjustments.\n\nThe most important thing was that his method of assembling the Immortal Gu House was deduced by the time path clone using the light of wisdom, it was very exemplary.\n\nHalf a month later in the sovereign immortal aperture’s time, Fang Yuan succeeded.\n\nThe golden light ball exploded as a brand new Immortal Gu House was formed.\n\nDifferent from Myriad Year Flying Warship, this Immortal Gu House was smaller and had the size of a regular bowl.\n\nIt was shining in golden light, it was covered in a pure white light, sacred and royal.\n\nIt was a pot, the pot’s rim was about a thumb’s thickness, the internal space was large but there was nothing inside now.\n\nOutside the pot, there were eight dragons, six were vivid and lively, while two were blurry and crude.\n\nThese eight dragons were all at the base of the pot, coiling around each other and extending their claws to become the legs of this pot.\n\nThe eight dragon tails pointed in eight different directions, towards the north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest.\n\nEach dragon claw was attached to the surface of the pot, the dragon bodies moved upwards as the dragon heads hung on the edge, looking inside. The dragon eyes were shut as if they were sleeping.\n\nRank six Immortal Gu House — Cooking Luck Pot!\n\nEven though rank seven Immortal Gu like food path Immortal Gu Cook were used, the core luck path Immortal Gu were still rank six, thus this Immortal Gu House had a slightly lower rank.\n\nThis Immortal Gu House was within the records of Giant Sun’s true inheritance, Fang Yuan’s time path clone had improved upon and modified it. Evidently, this was a luck path Immortal Gu House.\n\nIt could not carry Gu Immortals into battle, it was tiny and had another use.\n\nIn fact, it was quite similar to Star Constellation Chessboard.\n\nFang Yuan instilled his immortal essence as Cooking Luck Pot started to vibrate, it turned into a golden light and flew above Fang Yuan’s head, vanishing from sight.\n\nEven Fang Yuan could not see this Immortal Gu House with his naked eye, he had to use methods to verify its existence.\n\nIt was quite easy to ‘see’ it. Fang Yuan willed as he instilled immortal essence, activating one of Cooking Luck Pot’s killer moves.\n\nLuck inspection!\n\nFang Yuan’s vision changed rapidly, he saw that his luck was flowing into Cooking Luck Pot continuously.\n\nAfter a while, Cooking Luck Pot became filled with luck.\n\n“Luck inspection Immortal Gu is only rank six while I have rank eight cultivation level, just this Immortal Gu alone cannot inspect my luck.”\n\n“Cooking Luck Pot is only rank six, I can only see the luck inside this pot, but not the full extent of my luck.”\n\nEven so, Fang Yuan could still see a bit of his luck on the outside of the pot.\n\nThere was a river-like luck with clear and bright water, it seemed like a miniature River of Time, it was most connected to Fang Yuan. One end of the river extended into the pot while the other merged into empty space.\n\nThis was the luck of Fang Yuan’s time path clone.\n\nThe time path clone had stable luck, but a trace of black qi was forming and growing continuously. This was Spring Autumn Cicada’s drawback, it generated bad luck. Once in a while, Fang Yuan would need to use luck path methods against it.\n\nThere was another luck, it looked like a layer of pink fog, it was floating near the pot, circling around it.\n\nThis was the luck of Fang Yuan’s dream path clone.\n\nThe pink fog was weak and thin, it continued to change forms as it resembled a vague shadow.\n\nOnly after the dream path clone becomes rank six would it have comparable luck with the time path clone.\n\nOther than that, there was the dragonman clone’s luck, it was a tiny purple dragon flying near the pot. Fang Yuan’s clone in Beast Calamity grotto-heaven had a grey and dirty sparrow luck while his Profound Literature grotto-heaven clone had a flower bud luck that was wilting.\n\n“These two clones have weak luck. It seems that the grey soul ball consumed a lot of luck. And because they and my main body are separated by a small world, there is some obstruction.”\n\n“In that case…” Fang Yuan willed as he activated Cooking Luck Pot.\n\nCooking Luck Pot started to rise in temperature as the luck started to boil.\n\nTwo dragons at the edge of the pot opened their eyes and mouths, sucking at the luck in the pot.\n\nImmediately, two portions of luck were absorbed into the dragons’ stomachs.\n\nThe dragons started to move as their heads turned towards the grey sparrow and flower bud, spitting out at them.\n\nThe two spurts of luck shot out and fused into the grey sparrow luck and flower bud luck.\n\nInstantly, the grey sparrow chirped and turned into a sharp beaked eagle, it spread its wings and flew. Meanwhile, the flower bud luck seemed invigorated as it bloomed profusely in vibrant colors!"
