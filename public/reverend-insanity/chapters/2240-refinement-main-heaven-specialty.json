Because of the limitation of theft path attainment level, he could not modify ghostly concealment yet.\n\nHe had the ability to create refinement path killer moves similar to divine concealment and ghostly concealment, although it would be a difficult process and the price to pay would be great.\n\nDuring this period where the three venerables contested, if Fang Yuan invested a lot of his time and energy into creating a top tier refinement path killer move, it would be too risky.\n\nThe timing and opportunity did not allow Fang Yuan to do so.\n\nHowever, the refinement path resource points of the five regions and two heavens had a lot of value to him as references.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan simplified them and took out the true core, he would be able to modify them into mature passive killer moves that could be used to develop the immortal aperture.\n\nBasically, these passive killer moves were very rare among killer moves, they had great value.\n\nThe most common ones were defensive methods.\n\nSong Yi Shi’s pride came from this reason.\n\nDuke Long only had one of such a move too, it was called nine dragons protection.\n\nAs far as Fang Yuan knew, Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable created no more than five of such killer moves like divine concealment and ghostly concealment in his life.\n\nThe creation of a killer move starts with the use of multiple Gu worms by a predecessor to gain experience gradually. The Gu cultivation predecessors took reference to the innate abilities of the living beings in the five regions and two heavens to rapidly establish the foundation of killer moves.\n\nUntil today, the Gu cultivators had already hit the limit of this world.\n\nFor example, Duke Long created the dragonman race, Lang Ya land spirit created an artificial secluded domain, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable created soul beasts, he turned all sorts of soul path killer moves into dao marks that were carved onto soul beasts to grant them innate abilities.\n\nAll of these accomplishments showed that Gu cultivators had already rivaled the natural world, they were able to grasp the profundity of heaven and earth.\n\nAnd Limitless Demon Venerable went one step further.\n\nHe made an arrangement in Crazed Demon Cave, breaking the world boundary to create a hole and even making brand new heaven path dao marks. He had surpassed the entire Gu cultivator world singlehandedly.\n\nThis was the first time Fang Yuan was refining the refinement path dao marks of the outside world.\n\nWith his supreme grandmaster attainment level and manual practice, Fang Yuan gained a lot of insight.\n\nTo conclude —\n\nThe five regions and two heavens had a vast number of refinement path dao marks, but they were not evenly distributed, some places were dense while others were sparse. These refinement path dao marks were very stable and hard to change, normally speaking, their growth was extremely slow and needed a lot of time to accumulate.\n\nThese refinement path dao marks could be seen as the basis of the entire world’s refinement path foundation.\n\nOn this foundation, a large number of beasts, plants, and lifeless Gu materials were produced and nurtured.\n\nThese beasts and plants were related to refinement path, they were refinement path resources.\n\nNormally speaking, in places with dense refinement path dao marks, the relevant resources would also be more abundant and high quality. In places with sparse refinement path dao marks, there would be fewer refinement path resources and of lower quality.\n\nThe refinement path dao marks and resources had a deep influence on each other. For example, the coral group that Fang Yuan saw earlier was a refinement path resource point, the source was an immemorial sunken fish that died thousands of years ago, its refinement path dao marks scattered in the surroundings and a portion was left behind in that location.\n\nThe dao marks that Fang Yuan refined here were the refinement path foundation of the world.\n\nRefinement path resources were not included in this.\n\nThe natural dao marks that Fang Yuan refined were like a huge spider web. As long as Fang Yuan was in range, he would be able to sense all refinement path activities within the web.\n\nThis was the so-called refinement path sensation.\n\nFang Yuan had a vague sensation of the refinement path resources, he could also sense the refinement path activities of Gu cultivators.\n\nIn places with dense refinement path dao marks, the sensation would be more intense, stable, and clearer. For example, he would be able to find small-scale ordinary refinement path Gu materials.\n\nConversely, if the refinement path dao marks were sparse, the refinement path sensation would be weaker. In those regions, Fang Yuan would only be able to sense refinement path immortal materials.\n\nIf there was a hole in the spider web, or if a Gu Immortal refined Gu in their immortal aperture, Fang Yuan would not sense anything.\n\nUsing the refinement path dao marks that he refined, Fang Yuan could influence everything in that range, he could interfere with the living beings as well as the natural environment.\n\nFor example, he could help Song Yi Shi cultivate, strengthen refinement path resource points like the coral group, or even create a top tier refinement path passive killer move (like spaceless tunnel) that could exist indefinitely.\n\nSimply using refinement path dao marks to amplify his own strength was only the most basic use.\n\n“From the angle of refinement path, in the entire Gu cultivation world, the five regions and two heavens are just a giant immortal material. This immortal material comprises everything, it has dao marks of all paths.”\n\n“Even though I became a refinement path venerable, I can only refine a portion of this huge immortal material. This is true for Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, and all other venerables.”\n\n“Owning a portion of heaven and earth, this is what a Dao Lord entails!”\n\n“The other venerables are only able to become the Lord of one Dao, but I am different.”\n\nFang Yuan’s sovereign immortal body had non-conflicting dao marks, he cultivated all paths. The other venerables could do one main path and one specialty path at best, their main path would become their venerable path, while their specialty path would be used to fight and compete.\n\nIn theory, Fang Yuan could cultivate all the paths and become a venerable of all paths!\n\nThis was the intention of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable when he spent all his effort to refine sovereign immortal fetus Gu.\n\nFang Yuan had incomparable potential, the limit of his growth was unimaginable.\n\n“The other venerables also know this, the only reason why they did not kill me is because I displayed incredible battle strength in Crazed Demon Cave, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable knew that the price to kill me was too great, they could not take the backlash.”\n\nFang Yuan did not continue to refine dao marks.\n\nHe decided to stop for now.\n\nEven though Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus had bloomed again in the sovereign immortal aperture and gave him nearly a hundred immortal essence beads again.\n\nEven though he had all sorts of refinement path methods to raise his refinement efficiency by many times, far surpassing the venerables.\n\nThis was obvious.\n\nRefinement path most excelled in this aspect.\n\nIn terms of refinement path, he far surpassed the other two venerables, this was the advantage of refinement path to begin with.\n\n“However, I cannot display my advantage now, it will overly agitate those venerables.” Fang Yuan thought to himself.\n\nOnce he used his advantage, the two venerables would move.\n\nAlthough they felt that they had some advantage, if they saw that Fang Yuan’s dao mark refinement speed was so fast, they would not sit still, they would have to come and stop him.\n\nFang Yuan was not afraid of getting attacked by them.\n\nAfter all, he had enough immortal essence reserves now, although the quantity was not high, the two venerables could not kill him in a short time, as they fought, Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus would gradually accumulate an advantage for Fang Yuan.\n\nBut there was no point in going this far!\n\nMost importantly, it would cause Fang Yuan’s secret to be exposed, the existence of obscured heavenly secret, the loss was not worth the gain.\n\nBlindly using one’s advantage was the biggest trap in life.\n\nFang Yuan knew deeply that assessing the situation was most important.\n\n“Next, I need to refine dao marks with a slower speed, my efficiency should be around the same level as the two venerables, but I need to stop multiple times to pretend that I am out of immortal essence. Of course, I cannot be overly weak, otherwise, they will want to work together to get rid of me.”\n\nFang Yuan had a good grasp of this situation, he knew what to do.\n\nHe had abundant life experience after all.\n\nEspecially in the five hundred years of his previous life, all sorts of failure, pain, and losses became the valuable foundation that supported him.\n\n“Keeping a low profile while profiting greatly! By the time I expose this secret, I am sure the two venerables will not be able to keep their cool.”\n\nFang Yuan activated Cooking Luck Pot to inspect his luck again.\n\nHis luck still resembled a furnace.\n\nFang Yuan had inspected this many times already, he had some guesses about it.\n\nThis was caused by his status as a refinement path venerable, his luck’s appearance was stabilized and would not change for a period of time.\n\nThe furnace was still quite crude, it had cracks remaining.\n\nBut from the vast number of cracks, two or three of them had mended.\n\nThis was because the sovereign immortal aperture had already completed the first earth vein, the second one was on the way. It had also completed the first water vein.\n\nThese were all helping to stabilize his foundation.\n\nAnd compared to the past, there was a huge change on the surface of the furnace, there was a lotus flower pattern.\n\nThe lotus flower pattern was clearly referring to rank nine Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus. It showed how significant this Immortal Gu was to Fang Yuan!\n\nThe lotus flower pattern went one round around the outer layer of the furnace, it extended to the bottom and turned into several lotus roots.\n\nThese lotus roots went deep into the bottom of the furnace and burned together with the firewood that represented immortal essence.\n\nCompared to the weak fire earlier, the furnace was fully lit now, the flames expanded by several times, showing great growth.\n\nThere was no lid on the furnace, the scene inside could be seen.\n\nThe immortal crane cloud that symbolized heaven form and the green lotus cloud that was Heavenly Essence Treasure Imperial Lotus were both gone now.\n\nInstead, there was a piece of blue-white ice, symbolizing the truthful floating ice. The blue-white ice was heated in the furnace, slowly melting and generating a beautiful halo.\n\nAt the top of the furnace, there was a large amount of reddish brown sand dust, floating like a cloud.\n\nThe reddish brown sand dust condensed into one lump and slowly went into the furnace.\n\nIt was easily melted and infused into the furnace, fixing the cracks and slowly making the furnace smoother from its crude state.\n\n“This should be referencing my action of refining natural dao marks. If I go all out on this, the sand dust will pour down rapidly and block my opening of my furnace, it can even put out the fire at the bottom. Excessive progress is not good, this shows the terrible outcome of facing two venerables’ suppression at the same time.”\n\nFang Yuan had used luck inspection many times, he was able to reference the phenomena he saw to actual events that were happening more easily.\n\nEven though rank eight Cooking Luck Pot was too low in rank and did not suit the current Fang Yuan, it still displayed the profundity of luck path, reminding Fang Yuan that the most important variables to him now were refining dao marks and also heaven path development!\n\n“The refinement of dao marks can progress slowly, but I also need to unseal the truthful floating ice in secret. Right now, immortal essence is not my burden, it is my advantage instead. I need to use all my immortal essence and convert my resources into foundation and strength.”\n\nVenerables all had one main and one specialty path.\n\nFang Yuan had planned from long ago to use refinement path as his main, and heaven path as his specialty.\n\nRefinement path was his main cultivation, but refinement path itself was weak in the fighting aspect.\n\nThis was a publicly known fact.\n\nIn this situation, Fang Yuan needed another path to support his battle strength. This path should have few cultivators, for example, painting path. That would allow him to catch enemies off-guard and prevent them from having precaution against him.\n\nEven though there were many paths in existence, Fang Yuan did not have many choices, looking at his situation, heaven path was the best choice!\n\nThere were almost no heaven path cultivators, the criteria was too hard to achieve.\n\nHeaven path itself was very special and had extraordinary potential, its might was also unrivaled.\n\nRefinement path as main, heaven path as specialty.\n\nThis was Fang Yuan’s current cultivation plan.\n\nThe Heaven Refining Demon Venerable title that Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable gave to Fang Yuan was truly appropriate."
