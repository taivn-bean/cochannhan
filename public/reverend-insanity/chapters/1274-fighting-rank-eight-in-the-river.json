  "content": "If possible, Fang Yuan wanted to use affection Immortal Gu to trade for Immortal Gu that suited him more.\n\nBut in Reverse Flow River, transactions were impossible.\n\nBecause no Gu worms could be used, information path methods that allowed two parties to engage in transactions were unusable.\n\nFang Yuan wanted to exchange for Immortal Gu, but Bi Chen Tian could not take out any Immortal Gu, because Gu worms hibernated while inside Reverse Flow River, let alone those in an immortal aperture, they would not respond to any of a Gu Immortal’s summons even if they were inside their bodies.\n\nThus, Bi Chen Tian did not have any chips to use for trade.\n\nBi Chen Tian knew Fang Yuan’s concern, but should he give up this chance and wait for the future?\n\nWho knew what would happen in the future?\n\nAfter Black Extremity’s action, Snowy Mountain blessed land was gone, Central Continent’s Edge Link Camp was destroyed as well, if Central Continent’s group fought again, they would fall into an even deeper disadvantage.\n\nCentral Continent’s Gu Immortals were barely able to defend themselves, once they escaped Reverse Flow River, wouldn’t they flee immediately?\n\nThus, there was no chance to undergo trade with Fang Yuan.\n\nIf they did not do the transaction now, what about in the future?\n\nFang Yuan was a Northern Plains Gu Immortal, while Bi Chen Tian was a Central Continent Gu Immortal, both were in different regions, even in treasure yellow heaven, Central Continent could not dictate Fang Yuan to do a transaction with them later.\n\nWhat if he made a deal with someone else? What if he raised prices to an absurd level without fear?\n\nThere were worse situations possible.\n\nBi Chen Tian was someone with the foresight to consider bad outcomes in advance, seeing that he could not coax Fang Yuan to give the Immortal Gu, his killing intent rose!\n\n“I am a rank eight Gu Immortal, even if I cannot use Immortal Gu here, with my dao mark foundation, how can I lose to a rank seven Gu Immortal?”\n\nThinking like this, Bi Chen Tian jumped into the river water and swam towards Fang Yuan.\n\nAt this moment, his hostility was obvious.\n\nFang Yuan sneered internally, as he charged towards Bi Chen Tian as well.\n\nBi Chen Tian saw this and became joyful, thinking: “This Northern Plains Gu Immortal looks like a battle maniac. He’s simply brainless!”\n\nThe river water moved rapidly, but both parties had extraordinary bodies, they quickly met in the middle.\n\nBoom boom boom.\n\nFang Yuan raised his fist and punched at Bi Chen Tian thrice.\n\nBi Chen Tian was a wood path Gu Immortal, he had great stamina and eyesight, he blocked all three attacks.\n\nHe was shocked: “This person looks so young, how can he have such strength? Does he cultivate strength path?”\n\nHe felt that his arm was numb from blocking.\n\nBut while he was shocked, Bi Chen Tian still retaliated with his other hand.\n\nBoth sides exchanged fists, they quickly got into a scuffle.\n\nFang Yuan’s entire body was a weapon, his head, knee, elbow, and all sorts of jabs were used.\n\nBi Chen Tian was on the back foot, but soon, he held up evenly against Fang Yuan’s attacks. Because he had incredible foundation, and his close combat skills were very deep. Even though he had rarely used these techniques after becoming a Gu Immortal, currently in actual battle, he was recovering his combat skills.\n\nAs for Fang Yuan, he had become a Gu Immortal more recently, many years ago, he was a mortal Gu Master roaming Northern Plains and Southern Border, he was familiar with close combat.\n\nThe two fought in the water, at times, they lifted their heads above the water and breathed roughly, temporarily resting.\n\nReverse Flow River moved rapidly, most of their energy was spent in swimming, they did not actually fight too much.\n\nWhen they fought, the environment was very complex.\n\nBecause at times, logs or wild beasts would float down the river and force the two to evade them.\n\nAs a result, after tens of rounds of battle, both sides were breathing roughly, but they could do nothing to the other party.\n\n“This rank eight Gu Immortal is truly deep in foundation. I wanted to kill a rank eight in Reverse Flow River, but now it seems to be wishful thinking.”\n\nBi Chen Tian, however, was filled with shock.\n\n“How can this be? This person is on par with me?!”\n\n“I have used grass python Immortal Gu previously to gain a huge amount of strength.”\n\n“I have also used immortal killer move wood armor to carve dao marks in my body, my body has naturally strong defenses.”\n\n“I even turned my heart into a wood heart and turned my blood into green blood, giving me super healing abilities.”\n\n“These immortal killer moves and Immortal Gu, along with my dao marks as a rank eight Gu Immortal who has so many calamities and tribulations, I definitely outclass this rank seven.”\n\n“But why am I simply evenly matched with him?”\n\nBi Chen Tian stared at Fang Yuan, as if he was looking at a monster.\n\nSpeaking of which, Fang Yuan did not have as many dao marks as the rank eight Bi Chen Tian, but in fact, his dao mark accumulation surpassed most rank seven Gu Immortals. Even though he only became a rank seven Gu Immortal recently.\n\nWhat resisted Bi Chen Tian was the sovereign immortal body.\n\nThe sovereign immortal body was not a normal human body, it was refined from a Gu worm. Be it Wei Ling Yang or Bi Chen Tian, they were humans. But Fang Yuan’s body was made from a Gu worm.\n\nIt could therefore be said that Fang Yuan being a complete otherworldly demon was one of the reasons.\n\nThe sovereign immortal body made up for the difference in dao marks between him and Bi Chen Tian, allowing them to fight evenly.\n\nFang Yuan decided to retreat.\n\nEven though he did not lose, his intention was to kill the huge threat Ying Wu Xie.\n\nEarlier, when fighting with Bi Chen Tian, he wanted to test his strength, to see if he could kill a rank eight Gu Immortal.\n\nBut in fact, Fang Yuan was overly optimistic.\n\nHe could do nothing to Bi Chen Tian, Fang Yuan had to give up. He did not want to stall it out with Bi Chen Tian, his objective had not been met yet.\n\nFang Yuan wanted to leave, but Bi Chen Tian did not allow him to.\n\nEven though Bi Chen Tian could not do anything to Fang Yuan, affection Immortal Gu was still with Fang Yuan.\n\n“Even if I cannot win, I need to keep him here. If my companions come later, we can encircle him together. I cannot let him escape!”\n\n“Damn it, this guy.” Fang Yuan quickly frowned.\n\nHe wanted to retreat, but Bi Chen Tian’s speed and strength were not inferior to his, even though Fang Yuan wanted to leave, Bi Chen Tian was preventing him from doing so.\n\nThis gravely affected Fang Yuan’s plan.\n\n“In that case, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” Fang Yuan’s eyes flashed with cold light.\n\nObstructed by the wild beast corpse ahead, Fang Yuan’s speed fell and Bi Chen Tian reached him again.\n\nFang Yuan turned around to fight him.\n\nBoth were fighting with their fists and legs in Reverse Flow River, it was a draw, at the crucial moment, Fang Yuan stretched out his arm and placed affection Immortal Gu in front of himself.\n\nBi Chen Tian wanted to punch at Fang Yuan’s torso.\n\nIf he hit, Fang Yuan would lose his oxygen supply and would need to go to the surface and breathe in fresh air.\n\nThis was one of the key points of fighting underwater.\n\nBut Fang Yuan suddenly took out affection Immortal Gu, and put it in front of Bi Chen Tian’s fist.\n\nBi Chen Tian turned pale from shock, he quickly pulled back his fist and revealed a flaw.\n\nFang Yuan laughed coldly on the inside, he used this flaw and charged, Bi Chen Tian had made a mistake and could only block and defend himself, preparing to counterattack.\n\nBut Fang Yuan suddenly raised affection Immortal Gu in front of himself, causing Bi Chen Tian to be unable to attack and exposing a flaw.\n\nWith two flaws exposed, Fang Yuan made use of his advantage and kicked at Bi Chen Tian’s stomach.\n\nBi Chen Tian was hit and immediately opened his mouth as air bubbles floated up.\n\nHe did not have enough oxygen now, he changed his tactics and wanted to escape to the surface.\n\nBut Fang Yuan did not allow this, he stretched out his arms and gripped with them like pincers, pulling Bi Chen Tian and preventing him from reaching the surface.\n\nBi Chen Tian suddenly twisted his waist and escaped with a difficult maneuver. He moved like a fish, bursting out with strength, Fang Yuan’s left arm could not catch him.\n\nFang Yuan praised on the inside towards this response.\n\nBi Chen Tian was a Central Continent Gu Immortal, but his rank eight foundation really held no weaknesses. In terms of fighting underwater, he even slightly surpassed Fang Yuan.\n\nThere was a need to mention, Fang Yuan had lived in Eastern Sea for a long time during the five hundred years of his previous life.\n\nThis way, Bi Chen Tian instantly swam until he was on top of Fang Yuan."
