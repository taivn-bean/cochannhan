In the next few months, there will only be small wolf packs moving about. As the lightning lycan continues to call them back, as well the the Gu Masters killing them, the lightning wolves would basically vanish completely by the end of the year.\n\nBut conflicts never end.\n\nAt places with people, there are interests. And where there are interests involved, there are conflicts.\n\nDuring the wolf tide, it is the struggle between man and wolf. But now that the toughest part of the wolf tide is over, the clan’s internal struggles surface above the water, turning into internal strifes.\n\nThe wolf tide assaulting the village caused many Gu Masters to die. Some factions were destroyed, and the interests they once held, naturally has to be distributed.\n\nAmong the Gu Yue clan higher-ups, there were originally many clan elders to divide the interest cake of the entire village. But now that only Fang Yuan and the other elders amounting to less than ten remained, that cake was still whole and intact.\n\nTo split this large cake among themselves, they would have to compete against one another. Political battles, although not as flashy or bloody as the wolf tide, was full of schemes, plotting and setting traps; it was difficult and harsh.\n\nAt first, Fang Yuan as the only newly advanced elder, had a strong momentum and attracted great attention. But now that he admitted his mistake, it completely ruined his political career; it was tantamount to giving up the chance to compete for this interest cake with the other clan elders.\n\nAt once, Fang Yuan’s threat level towards the other clan elders became much lower.\n\nTheir gaze towards Fang Yuan showed that the pressure they felt towards him had reduced.\n\nAt this time, clan leader Gu Yue Bo sighed, “Since Fang Yuan himself admitted to it, as clan leader, I have to punish you for the act of running away from battle. According to the clan ancestor’s rules, runaways will be stripped of their clan elder status, but the final result shall be decided by me and the other clan elders. We’ll decide on your punishment after a discussion. But regardless of the result, I hope you can accept it.”\n\nThe others showed a weird expression.\n\nFang Yuan nodded, not speaking, as if he had submitted to fate.\n\nGu Yue Yao Ji broke her own arm to save her life, this was decisive and ruthless. Fang Yuan was the same, except he lost even more, giving up his clan elder status.\n\nHis greatest problem now, is the sudden appearance of the Tie family father and daughter. If he got involved in the political turmoil now, facing suppression from other elders, his situation would get even more dangerous.\n\n“Letting go, willingness to let go, among taking and letting go, that is life. The identity of clan elder was to cultivate better, that is its only purpose to me. To pursue eternal life I walked on the demonic path, I am willing to discard my own life. What else can I not discard? Clan elder status, hmph…”\n\nFang Yuan did not feel a shred of regret or annoyance.\n\nThis was the wisest decision.\n\nMoreover, although there’s a punishment, it would definitely be minimized.\n\nAfter all, there were little clan elders left, and as a Rank three Gu Master, his strength was greatly valued. The clan leader has to punish him on one end, but also needs to borrow his strength to stabilize the entire village’s circumstance, thus he also needed to give in to Fang Yuan.\n\nAs for the other clan elders, Fang Yuan had stepped out of this political contest and no longer held any threat. They would not offend Fang Yuan anymore. After all, if they force Fang Yuan to retaliate, isn’t it finding trouble for themselves?\n\n“Although there is the clan system, but what is a system? Hehe, a system is just a tool to maintain the interests of those in power. On one hand it governs and divides the interest of the lower levels, but it is also the rules that contain the higher-ups as they compete against each other.” Fang Yuan laughed coldly. These matters, he was clear as day, the truth was transparent to him.\n\n“The most crucial point now, is the Tie family father and daughter. Fuck, they came much earlier than I had anticipated, even before the wolf tide is completely gone. Hmph! But such a behavior perfectly fits Tie Xue Leng’s hatred towards evil, and his selflessness in fighting crime.”\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan felt a strong pressure.\n\nEven though Tie Xue Leng is injured now, his battle strength was not something Fang Yuan could compete against. A starving dying camel is larger than a horse, it is this logic.\n\n“I need to leave the village, but I also need to avoid the pursuit of the Tie father and daughter pair, how can I get out of this predicament?”\n\nFang Yuan was vexed.\n\nThis Tie family father and daughter was not as easy to confuse as Jia Fu. Moreover, Fang Yuan’s cultivation was too low. Even if he had a thousand and one plans, what could he do without actual strength?\n\nRank three and five, it was a world of difference.\n\n“Everyone, I have something to say.” At this point, the silent Gu Yue Mo Chen suddenly said.His expression was pale as he had dragged his injured body to the banquet, and he did not drink wine, only sipping tea.\n\nBut what he said next, shocked people to death, “There’s something I have to be honest about. Elder Fang Yuan did not manage to enter the battlefield, and that was due to me.”\n\n“What?”\n\nAt once, the other clan elders were shocked.\n\n“Oh, what do you mean?” Gu Yue Bo asked.\n\nFang Yuan sent a glance over, hiding his shock.\n\nWhy would this Gu Yue Mo Chen stand up for himself?\n\nDuring this wolf tide, the Mo faction inheritor Gu Yue Mo Bei had already died unfortunately.\n\nEven though the Mo faction had to the greatest of their ability, protected Mo Bei. On the battlefield, surprises were aplenty. Moreover, during the wolf tide, everyone was in danger, sometimes they can’t even take care of themselves, what more towards others?\n\nGu Yue Mo Chen sighed, “To speak the truth, my granddaughter Gu Yue Mo Yan had fallen deep in love with elder Fang Yuan. Before this, she had come to beg me, kneeling on the ground and crying, not willing to see Fang Yuan die on the battlefield. I only have one granddaughter, thus out of selfishness, I kept Fang Yuan in my estate and knocked him out. It was only until we chased the lightning crown wolf that I let him out. Thus, everything was due to me, it is my fault. It has nothing to do with Fang Yuan.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Oh, is that really it?”\n\nThe clan elders were suspicious.\n\nGu Yue Mo Chen’s words were quite a stretch; it was rather unbelievable.\n\n“Love and relationship among youngsters is common,” Gu Yue Bo nodded, staring at Fang Yuan with deep meaning, wanting to find out some clues from his expression.\n\nBut Fang Yuan looked down with a calm expression. There was nothing to see.\n\nClan leader was disappointed.\n\nThe other clan elders exchanged glances, not understanding why Gu Yue Mo Chen was so defensive of Fang Yuan.\n\nHim saying this in order to aid Fang Yuan, it meant that he had sacrificed his own reputation and ruined his own political prospect!!\n\nGu Yue Mo Chen continued, “In order to protect my reputation, elder fang Yuan willingly let himself suffer the injustice. But I have already erred once, how can I make a mistake once more? This is the truth. As for the punishment, I implore lord clan leader to consider. I admit my mistake and as with the rules, if my clan elder status is to be stripped, I have no objections.”\n\nClan leader quickly waved his hand, saying, “Elder Mo Chen has worked hard all these years. What you did was understandable, humans are not grass or wood, how can we not have feelings? Now that our clan is greatly weakened, we need loyal and strong elders like you. But this is still your own selfishness, thus the punishment still needs to be decided. We have an important guest today, let’s not talk about this now. Come, brother Tie, I and the clan elders shall offer you a toast!”\n\nSaying so, Gu Yue Bo stood up.\n\nThe other clan elders stood up as well, raising their cups.\n\n“Everyone is too kind. I still have to trouble you all later, I hope I can seek your understanding.” Tie Xue Leng did not put on airs, standing up and drinking his wine.\n\n…\n\nIn the courtyard of the Mo faction, flora and fauna were abundant. The artificial mountain had a spring flowing with crystal clear water.\n\nIn the night sky, the moon hung high in the sky like a plate.\n\nThe banquet had long ended.\n\nFang Yuan sat in the cooling pavilion as he listened to the sound of the flowing water, and he placed down his tea cup with a plain expression.\n\nSitting opposite him was Gu Yue Mo Chen. After the banquet was over, he had invited Fang Yuan over for a discussion.\n\n“Come, have another cup of tea, this bamboo leaf clear water tea is good in eliminating hangovers.” Gu Yue Mo Chen laughed, pouring personally into Fang Yuan’s cup.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression was calm, and on seeing the cup being filled again, he said, “Indeed a good cure for hangovers.”\n\nSaying so, he looked outside the pavilion, only to see that the pale white moon had radiated the grounds with its moonlight. Under the moon, the pavilion was quiet and graceful, but in the wind there were lurking shadows, showing how the Mo faction courtyard was turning from a prosperous state, to a declining one.\n\nDuring the banquet, Fang Yuan had already understood Gu Yue Mo Chen’s intention. Seeing this scene, he was even more sure of himself.\n\nThe Mo faction had no inheritor left!\n\nOnce Gu Yue Mo Bei died, the entire Mo faction would lose its inheritor.\n\nAlthough Mo Bei still had his sister Mo Yan, the clan rules was that, since ancient times, it favored males over females, and the assets can only be inherited by a male and not female.\n\nEven if Gu Yue Mo Yan gets to Rank three next time and advances to clan elder, her assets do not represent the Mo faction, but only her own. If she married anyone, this asset will be transferred to under her husband’s name.\n\nIf they lost their inheritor, a clan’s political influence would have no prospects, and no one would join them.\n\nThe Mo faction had already fallen into difficult circumstances, on the verge of breaking down.\n\nBut heaven always left a way, and the Mo faction was not truly at its wits end; there was still a sliver of hope.\n\nThis hope lies in Gu Yue Mo Yan’s hands.\n\nAlthough she is a female, she can marry someone.\n\nIf the son-in-law marries into the Mo faction, he would have an acceptable status, and can inherit the Mo faction!\n\nSeeing that Fang Yuan had no inclination to mention it, Gu Yue Mo Chen scolded this crafty lad internally, but had to speak, “I wonder what elder Fang Yuan thinks of my Mo faction?”\n\nHe had an unspeakable grief.\n\nEver since his injury, his cultivation had fallen to Rank two, without any chance of ever regaining Rank three.\n\nHe could only rely on his Gu worm to conceal his true aura. But paper cannot cover fire; he would be exposed one day.\n\nHis only inheritor had died, while he himself was Rank two and would lose his clan elder identity. Gu Yue Mo Chen needed someone who could hold the fort to sustain their faction.\n\nBack then, he had both authority and status, thus the Mo faction controlled a large amount of the interest cake. But now that the clan’s factions were reorganising themselves, he did not want any more interests. As long as he can defend what he already has, that would be the biggest victory.\n\nHe pondered left and right, and the most suitable person was Fang Yuan without doubt!"
