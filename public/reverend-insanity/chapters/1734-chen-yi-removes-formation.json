This is truly wonderful.”\n\nThe morale of the Southern Alliance and Northern Plains immortals soared.\n\nThey changed their battle tactic.\n\nThey had already seen through this formation and could clearly target the flaw to destroy the formation, but now, they were not in a hurry to do so.\n\nThe five regional smoke constantly spread and they used this to deal with the Central Continent Gu Immortals who were inside the formation.\n\nIn a way, nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation had instead become the strong weapon for Fang Yuan’s group to attack Central Continent and Heavenly Court’s experts.\n\n“How should we deal with this? Do we send people to destroy their formation?” Bai Cang Shui looked at Chen Yi.\n\nThe leader of this group was Chen Yi.\n\nChen Yi looked unsightly as he said: “This formation should have originated from the five regional true inheritance, it is the method of Southern Border’s Tao Zhu.”\n\nHeavenly Court had interfered in the five regional mountain range battle, Jun Shen Guang was captured alive by Fang Yuan in this battle. Thus, Heavenly Court knew detailed information about Tao Zhu’s true inheritance and the five regional mountain range battle.\n\n“Tao Zhu could create the five regional mountain range, so this five colored smoke that is pervading the formation is clearly imitating the five regional walls and is making our side suffer from backlash.”\n\nChen Yi’s tone was quite bitter: “The nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation is a multi-layered formation, we can easily get rid of or add a sub-formation and hence sustain it indefinitely. Back then, Limitless Demon Venerable had to break a hundred formations to get out of this formation.”\n\n“But Tao Zhu’s method gets around the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation and targets our Gu Immortals instead!”\n\n“Not only are they avoiding the formation but the stronger our formation is, the stronger the backlash to the Gu Immortals in charge of the formation.”\n\n“If we activate the formation to deal with the enemy’s formation, we will fall into the enemy’s trap, we cannot do that.”\n\n“But if we temporarily stop the formation and send our people out of the formation, we will be giving up our advantage and fighting with our weakness. Moreover, the enemies include ruthless people like Wu Yong and Fang Yuan, the Gu Immortals we send out will be in huge danger.”\n\nChen Yi had been struck by Wu Yong’s farewell friend wind and was saved by Feng Jiu Ge, he still felt lingering fear.\n\nMore importantly, they only had three rank eights: Chen Yi, Bai Cang Shui, and Feng Jiu Ge. Moreover, they all had some level of injuries and were not suited to be sent out.\n\nChen Yi sighed deeply as he analyzed until here: “Who could have thought the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation would be countered by the enemy!”\n\nTao Zhu was only an ordinary rank eight Gu Immortal who could not even be mentioned alongside Wu Yong and Fang Yuan, while the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation was created by the famous and mighty Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nThe five regional true inheritance was able to counter nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation, this was Tao Zhu’s glory!\n\n_1_While alive, Tao Zhu was not prominent among rank eight Gu Immortals or even remotely famous, he only created the five regional mountain range.\n\nNo one had expected his research to truly succeed.\n\nAfter this battle, Tao Zhu’s name would spread throughout the world despite him having been dead for a long time already.\n\nEach generation brings forth new geniuses and each will rule their domain for years to come.\n\nLike how Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable’s perfect pair killer move was countered in the battle in Heavenly Court, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation was also countered by geniuses of the future generations.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable and Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable had died too long ago while the eras continued to progress. Their methods were powerful, but they could not escape from the trials of time as it flows continuously.\n\n“Remove that sub-formation.” Chen Yi ordered resolutely.\n\nThe Gu Immortals beside him were shocked.\n\nChen Yi actually sent the command to remove the formation, did he get muddle-headed?\n\nBut soon after, Feng Jiu Ge was the first to react, his eyes shining brightly as he praised: “Great idea.”\n\n“They actually removed the formation, hahaha.” Inside five regional formation, some Northern Plains Gu Immortals started laughing heartily at this sight.\n\nWu Yong and Fang Yuan, however, had slightly sunken expressions.\n\n“This is not good, Chen Yi is truly crafty.”\n\n“If we are inside their formation, the five colored smoke can invade faster and deeper. Now that they have removed the sub-formation, its efficiency will decrease greatly.”\n\n“Indeed. Over at Heavenly Court’s battlefield, Longevity Heaven is already unable to hold on and Heavenly Court is firmly occupying the upper hand. Chen Yi probably considered this so he adopted the delaying tactic.”\n\nFang Yuan’s group would have been happy to see Chen Yi’s side activating the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation or sending people to attack their formation.\n\nBut now, Chen Yi took the initiative to remove the sub-formation, choosing to defend passively.\n\nThe five colored smoke’s invasion slowed down greatly, Central Continent immortals only maintained the formation and did not activate it so they suffered from weaker backlash.\n\nOn the contrary, Chen Yi was still behind the formation, continuing to arrange immortal formations!\n\nFang Yuan’s group needed even more time to destroy this nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation as a result.\n\nThe most crucial thing was that Fang Yuan’s group had to fight for every second, they could not delay for even one moment. Once Heavenly Court eliminates Longevity Heaven’s forces, they would rush here to deal with Fang Yuan’s group.\n\nChen Yi was very calm with his deep experience.\n\nHe purposely backed down, it was only a small step back in the overall picture, but it instead became an even more terrifying offensive move.\n\nHe directly forced Fang Yuan’s group towards the edge of the cliff.\n\n“Sigh, if I had known this, I would have made Formation Spirit and formation flag Immortal Gu take part in the five regional formation. With that, five regional formation could be mobile and would not have to be fixed in one place.”\n\nFang Yuan mentally sighed.\n\nThis was not his mistake, and it was not that he was unwilling to contribute.\n\nIf Formation Spirit and formation flag Immortal Gu were to be joined with the five regional formation, the amount of things to deduce would increase sharply and it would consume a lot of Fang Yuan’s time.\n\nIn fact, even if the five regional formation could be moved, Fang Yuan’s group would not be able to resolve the current crisis.\n\nChen Yi took the initiative to dispel the sub-formation and retreated to a defensive position. The five regional formation inside the sub-formation was now exposed.\n\nThere was already a chaotic battle going on outside the nine-nine consecutive unceasing formation.\n\nFour rank eight Gu Immortals, Qing Ye, Li Huang, Prince Feng Xian, and Ba Shi Ba, were engaged in a ferocious fight. Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building, Frost Dragon Manor, Wind Sweeping Building, and other Immortal Gu Houses were rampaging in the battlefield, occasionally colliding against each other or erupting with immortal killer moves, dazzling lights and explosions resounded everywhere.\n\n“Not good, unlimited wind is getting out of my control.” Wu Yong’s expression changed.\n\nPreviously, he had been inside the formation and had not clearly sensed it. Now that Chen Yi had removed the formation, Wu Yong clearly felt something wrong.\n\nWithout any delay, Wu Yong flew out of the five regional formation and charged at Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nYao Huang, Heavenly Lord Bai Zu and others also made their moves.\n\nWith their support, Li Huang, Qing Ye and others felt huge pressure. They had to retreat again and again, and soon, they along with Central Continent’s Immortal Gu Houses were getting suppressed.\n\nFang Yuan quietly moved out before suddenly using great thief ghost hand.\n\nCentral Continent’s Immortal Gu Houses immediately met with disaster as Fang Yuan stole a large amount of Gu worms.\n\nFang Yuan grabbed repeatedly and soon obtained three Immortal Gu. Adding on his gains from the battle in Emperor City, he had already stolen over ten Immortal Gu from Central Continent’s Immortal Gu Houses.\n\nAs for these Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan recognized some of them while there were some which he did not recognize.\n\nHis time path clone was staying inside the light of wisdom, continuously deducing the ways in which these Gu worms could be used.\n\nSeeing that the situation was going awry, Li Huang got away from Prince Feng Xian and hurried to fight Fang Yuan.\n\nThe previous scene in Emperor City played out once again.\n\nFang Yuan was entangled by Li Huang and was unable to easily target Immortal Gu Houses.\n\n“Hmph, this Prince Feng Xian is acting so well, intentionally letting go of Li Huang without commotion.” Fang Yuan mentally snorted.\n\nPrince Feng Xian was a problem.\n\nWhat made Fang Yuan feel even more problematic was Heavenly Court’s rank nine human path killer move — Heroes Among People.\n\nWith the amplification from heroes among people, Li Huang, Qing Ye, as well as Central Continent’s Immortal Gu Houses had their strength increased by several times. Thus they were able to block the joint offense of Southern Border and Northern Plains.\n\n“We don’t have time to continue such a chaotic battle! Let’s retreat to the formation.” Fang Yuan called out.\n\nWu Yong and the rest slowly moved back and collected their Immortal Gu Houses before retreating to the five regional formation.\n\nThe five regional formation was activated completely, large amounts of five colored smoke quickly spread and shrouded the whole battlefield.\n\nInside the five colored smoke, Central Continent’s Gu Immortals felt a powerful suppression.\n\nLike the awkward state of Chen Yi before, these people who had been strengthened by heroes among people had their killer moves amplified as well which caused the backlash to increase steeply.\n\n“I did not expect Tao Zhu’s method to be so profound!” Inside the formation, Ba Shi Ba was moved and sighed.\n\nWu Yong was silent.\n\nThis situation was within his expectations.\n\nBecause he had already discovered this, he did not stint on exposing the contents of the true inheritance and seeking to collaborate with Chi Qu You.\n\nChi Qu You also knew this was a good thing but did not have a method to use it before. Now that the formation was modified and successfully arranged, it immediately showed its effects.\n\n“It is a pity this five colored smoke does not distinguish between enemies and allies, Central Continent is suppressed but we can also suffer from backlash.”\n\n“Only Fang Yuan can move freely.” Yao Huang said encouragingly.\n\nMany people looked at Fang Yuan, revealing envious expressions.\n\n“Such a pity.” Fang Yuan inwardly sighed, if he could obtain Tao Zhu’s true inheritance, relying on the light of wisdom as well as his powerful formation path and wisdom path attainment levels, his battle strength would rise sharply.\n\nFor example, he had no way to deal with heroes among people, but if he had the five colored smoke, Li Huang’s group would suffer from an even greater suppression. Who was to say if Fang Yuan might be able to suppress the battle in Emperor City singlehandedly?\n\nBack then, when he had escaped from the five regional mountain range and could not take five regional true inheritance, he had felt it was a huge loss.\n\nLooking at it now, his premonition back then was not wrong."
