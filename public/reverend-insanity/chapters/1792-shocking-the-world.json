  "content": "Chapter 1792 Shocking The World\n\nA crystal mountain stood tall within Mini Southern Border.\n\nIt was pink throughout and gave off a dreamy illusory light, it was the famous secluded domain of heaven and earth recorded in u003cu003cThe Legends of Ren Zuu003eu003e — Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nRight now, Dang Hun Mountain had almost fully regained its former glory.\n\nBut it was not entirely repaired yet.\n\nLike the previous life, Fang Yuan was worried that Heavenly Court might have a method similar to Fixed Immortal Travel’s killer move.\n\nOf course, it was already extremely close to complete restoration, the decline in guts Gu production was negligible, Fang Yuan could accept it.\n\nRank six rockman Gu Immortal Shi Shi Cheng arrived before the mountain.\n\nEven though he knew that Fang Yuan had guts Gu, when he saw this legendary mountain personally, he was greatly stirred, excitement flashed in his eyes with incomparable light!\n\n“Dang Hun Mountain, guts Gu…” He muttered.\n\nGuts Gu had an incredible significance to the rockmen.\n\nRockmen were all male, they had strong and tough bodies that created a huge burden on their soul. The more active a rockman was, the more damage their soul would receive. Thus, rockmen would spend eighty percent of their whole life sleeping and nurturing their soul.\n\nAfter an old rockman dies, the soul and rocks they split into will form new rockmen, and inherit a portion of the old rockman’s memories, or some important experiences. In some cases, old rockmen sleep too much and their soul foundation accumulates to a degree, they would split apart a portion of their bodies to form new tiny rockmen.\n\nThis unique reproduction method meant that the rockman’s soul was the key to their strength.\n\nThe stronger the rockman’s soul, the more rockmen they could reproduce.\n\nHowever, rockmen were variant humans that possessed earth path dao marks from birth, it conflicted with soul path. Thus, soul path methods that could increase the strength of their soul were very rare for the rockmen.\n\nBut guts Gu was different, it was formed from a secluded domain of heaven and earth, even though it was a mortal Gu, its ability to strengthen the soul could affect even Gu Immortals. After a rockman used it, the effect would be quite extraordinary. Back then, when Fang Yuan had just obtained Hu Immortal blessed land, he also nurtured some rockmen.\n\nShi Shi Cheng looked at Dang Hun Mountain as he could almost see the rise of his entire rockman tribe, they had a way to become stronger now, how could he not feel excited?\n\nHis emotions surged intensely, he felt that the decision to follow Fang Yuan was extremely wise for both him and the rockman tribe.\n\nFang Yuan was observing all of Shi Shi Cheng’s expressions.\n\nHe was quite satisfied by it.\n\nThis time, Fang Yuan purposely asked Shi Shi Cheng to come over while collecting guts Gu, it was to lure him and feel that the future was bright, as long as he followed Fang Yuan, he would gain an incredible amount of benefits.\n\nAfter a while, Shi Shi Cheng calmed down as he started to control the formation.\n\nFang Yuan had formation path and soul path attainment, he did not lack Immortal Gu, furthermore, soul path cultivation was most important right now, he went around Dang Hun Mountain and set up an immortal formation.\n\nShi Shi Cheng was given permission by Fang Yuan to manipulate the formation.\n\nThe formation resonated, a grey-blue light was shot out, it was like fog or smoke, quickly surrounding the whole of Dang Hun Mountain.\n\nDang Hun Mountain shook lightly, the pink crystal mountain gave off a faint light that quickly dyed the grey-blue fog into a pink color.\n\nThe pink color spread in the fog and quickly covered the entire formation.\n\nThere was a large number of soul beasts and soul cores inside the formation.\n\nUnder the effect of the pink fog, the soul beasts and soul cores vanished rapidly without a trace.\n\nAfter a while of operation, guts Gu started forming, going from single digits to the thousands.\n\nShi Shi Cheng expressed deep shock on his face.\n\n“What sort of efficiency is this!”\n\n“The number of guts Gu is still increasing so rapidly, it is reaching tens of thousands soon.”\n\nThis soul path formation was created by modifying the contents of Spectral Soul true inheritance, along with Fang Yuan’s own Immortal Gu, he named it soul expending myriad guts formation.\n\nIt produced at least ten thousand guts Gu each time!\n\nThis was definitely more efficient than using Dang Hun Mountain alone.\n\nOf course, the condition was that he needed enough soul beasts and soul cores to create ten thousand guts Gu.\n\nFang Yuan had already prepared sufficiently.\n\nEarlier, he had arranged cooperation with Fang clan to develop the green ghost desert in Western Desert.\n\nThis was a way to obtain soul beasts stably in huge quantity.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan had such a terrifying appetite for soul beasts and soul cores, green ghost desert was able to fulfill his needs with great ease.\n\nThis desert was too huge, it had countless soul beasts, it was truly a soul path giant resource point!\n\nIt was a pity that this desert was inside the territory of Fang clan which cultivated formation path.\n\nAnd Qing Chou was still hiding inside green ghost desert, it was a huge threat. As long as it remained, green ghost desert would have a fatal danger, it was not a safe place.\n\nFang Yuan did not even think of buying soul cores in treasure yellow heaven or extorting Southern Border’s Yang clan, because doing that would leak some important information.\n\nIn the previous life, Fang Yuan only repaired Dang Hun Mountain a long time after now, even after he repaired it, he lacked immortal essence, soul beasts, and soul cores, his progress was greatly delayed.\n\nThis time around, not only did he repair Dang Hun Mountain early, he even had a good supply of soul beasts and soul cores, this would allow his soul path foundation to rise rapidly.\n\nFang Yuan’s soul went into the soul expending myriad guts formation directly.\n\nWith the use of the formation to help him absorb guts Gu, Fang Yuan used ten thousand guts Gu in an instant.\n\nThe effect of guts Gu was so evident, his soul inflated like a balloon, becoming a giant in just a few breaths of time.\n\nFang Yuan’s soul flew out of the formation, arriving at Luo Po Valley who was nearby.\n\nBewilderment fog covered his soul as it started to become looser.\n\nLuo Po wind cut and sliced his soul, the wounds that it created were incomparably painful!\n\nPain, pain, pain!\n\nThis pain originated from the depths of the soul, it was more painful than dying by a thousand cuts, Fang Yuan was almost going berserk.\n\nBut he controlled himself, a moment later, he flew out with a heavily damaged soul.\n\nGoing back into the soul path formation, he used the guts Gu to recover as his size expanded again.\n\nGuts Gu was the most perfect nutrient for the soul, while the cultivation in Luo Po Valley made his soul as tempered as steel, all the impurities were removed.\n\nLike this, after three rounds, Fang Yuan’s soul reached ten million man soul!\n\nShi Shi Cheng, who was controlling the formation became tongue-tied, he was extremely shocked, being in disbelief.\n\nDang Hun Mountain and Luo Po Valley were the sacred lands for soul cultivation, their reputation was deeply justified.\n\nFang Yuan sighed to himself, thinking: “The toughest part is finally over.”\n\nEarlier, because his soul foundation was expending rapidly, he was almost forced to use other soul foundation methods.\n\nEven though these soul path methods were exceptional, they all had drawbacks, only Dang Hun Mountain and Luo Po Valley were perfect in their usage.\n\nFor example, it was like lifespan extension methods compared to lifespan Gu.\n\n“Oh my heavens…” Shi Shi Cheng praised as he sighed deeply.\n\nHe had finally reacted and accepted this dream-like truth.\n\nFang Yuan’s soul foundation rose like he was on a rocket, it almost shattered Shi Shi Cheng’s common sense, his sense of value and life were also in deep chaos.\n\nHe could not express his agitated feelings in words, his fingers were trembling.\n\n“As long as we follow Lord Fang Yuan and walk behind him, our rockman tribe will definitely reach the peak of this world!”\n\n“With these two soul path sacred lands, we will have foundation that surpasses the five regions’ Gu Immortal world.”\n\nShi Shi Cheng had no idea that Fang Yuan was not satisfied yet: “It is a pity I do not have pacifying soul soup, otherwise, my soul path cultivation speed will be even faster and more terrifying!”\n\nWisdom path cultivation emphasized on three aspects of thoughts, wills and emotions. Soul path also had three aspects of strengthening, refining, and pacifying the soul.\n\nThe former two had the ultimate methods of cultivation, they were Dang Hun Mountain and Luo Po Valley. Meanwhile, pacifying soul soup from the Bewitching Lake would pacify the soul, this was recorded in u003cu003cThe Legends of Ren Zuu003eu003e.\n\nAfter reaching a certain level of soul cultivation, the soul would gradually detach from the body, the soul (a portion) would fly out and result in incidents like blanking out or being physically unconscious.\n\nAt this time, drinking pacifying soul soup would resolve this problem.\n\nFang Yuan did not have pacifying soul soup, he could only use other methods instead, they were not as good as his other two cultivation methods.\n\nThis also caused Fang Yuan to only be able to cultivate soul path once in a while. Even though the efficiency was already out of this world, Shi Shi Cheng was nearly shocked to death, but if he had pacifying soul soup, he could almost endlessly cultivate without stopping.\n\nHaste makes waste, Fang Yuan had to temporarily halt his soul cultivation.\n\nA commotion occurred in treasure yellow heaven.\n\nHeavenly Court started to spread rumors that Fang Yuan was reaching rank eight soon, he might be undergoing tribulation very soon, he was close to his rank eight tribulation.\n\nOther than that, information that Fang Yuan captured the Southern Border Gu Immortals had also been spread by Heavenly Court.\n\nFang Yuan sneered:” This must be the work of Fairy Zi Wei.”\n\nIn the previous life, Fairy Zi Wei did this too, but that was at a later time.\n\nIn this life, Fang Yuan progressed rapidly and gave Fairy Zi Wei immense pressure, she used this method earlier than last time.\n\nIn fact, this move was quite vicious.\n\nFairy Zi Wei would be able to borrow the strength of every Gu Immortal that feared Fang Yuan and did not want him to reach rank eight, they would pursue and deal with him.\n\nIn the previous life, during the Five Regional Mountain Range battle, Fang Yuan used this to his advantage as he made use of these Gu Immortals’ intentions.\n\n“If not for the sovereign immortal aperture, I would fall into Fairy Zi Wei’s trap and she would gain initiative in this matter.”\n\n“Now that she is spreading rumors like this, it means she has not discovered the true secret of the sovereign immortal body.”\n\n“Of course, it is possible that she knew but pretended not to, spreading out rumors like this as the start of her devious plan.”\n\nFang Yuan started to use wisdom path methods as he thought intensely.\n\nA moment later, a sharp light flashed in his eyes, he made a new decision.\n\n“In this case, I will not wait around aimlessly, let’s expose your star cast killer move, as well as news of Chen Yi’s and Thunder Ghost True Monarch’s death.”\n\nFairy Zi Wei was trying to borrow strength, Fang Yuan was doing the same.\n\nCompared to Fang Yuan, Heavenly Court was a bigger source of wariness and fear among the four regions.\n\nIn the previous life, Heavenly Court’s Gu refinement was met with the attack of all four regions, Fang Yuan’s spread of information had a lot to do with it.\n\n“This time, I will reveal my battle strength, after all, I cannot conceal the matter in Southern Border anymore.”\n\n“Since the world will be shocked by it, let’s go ahead and make them fear me even more.”\n\n“This way, it will help with my extortion of the Southern Border righteous path later.”\n\nAs expected, Fang Yuan and Heavenly Court exposed information about each other once more, it caused countless Gu Immortals to gasp in shock.\n\nInformation spread like wildfire, soon, the entire Gu Immortal world knew about it.\n\nThe world was shocked!"
