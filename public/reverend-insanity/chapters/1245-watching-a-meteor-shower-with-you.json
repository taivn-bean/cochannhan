Outside the window, countless glaring starlight specks were shining in, turning the entirety of Wind Sweeping Building blue.\n\nZhao Lian Yun felt like she was on a plank in a stormy sea, she was enduring the might of the tides and strikes of lightning.\n\nHer mouth was dry, she was scared, even with Gu Immortal battle strength, she could not resolve this problem.\n\nShe could only rely on the Immortal Gu Houses, on the three rank eight great experts.\n\nZhao Lian Yun did not know that among the three rank eight Gu Immortals, Myriad Tidal Dragon was sleeping now. Thankfully, Wind Sweeping Building was under Bi Chen Tian’s control, the situation was better than Canary Pavilion.\n\nBut even so, Bi Chen Tian was covered in sweat, he was concentrating and did not dare to relax his mind.\n\nHe moved Wind Sweeping Building and traveled in the star cloud storm, continuously avoiding the huge stars.\n\nThese stars moved quickly, if Wind Sweeping Building crashed into them, it would suffer huge damage. Even though Wind Sweeping Building was an Immortal Gu House, and would not break apart from just a few stars, in this situation, once Wind Sweeping Building loses control of its movement, it would slow down and be hit by endless number of stars. If that happened, it would be destroyed inside this star cloud storm, everyone would die.\n\n“Gu Immortals are powerful, and Immortal Gu Houses are useful, but against the might of heaven and earth, we are still minuscule and insignificant.” Bi Chen Tian gritted his teeth: “Oh no!”\n\nHe could not react in time, Wind Sweeping Building finally got hit, a hill-like star crashed into Wind Sweeping Building with the ferocity of a storm.\n\nWind Sweeping Building’s entire size was less than ten percent of the star.\n\nBut it was an Immortal Gu House, it was sturdy.\n\nIt was the star which shattered instead of Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nBut the impact of the star’s collision sent Wind Sweeping Building flying far away through brute force.\n\nThe three Immortal Gu Houses were working together and flying alongside each other earlier, but now, the other two Immortal Gu Houses dodged the star while Wind Sweeping Building was pushed away from the group.\n\n“Bi Chen…. quick…..” Wei Ling Yang’s voice could be heard.\n\nBut in this star cloud storm, fragments were everywhere, the uncountable number of star path dao marks were disrupting the information path communication method of Wei Ling Yang and Bi Chen Tian.\n\nBi Chen Tian could only hear a short and incomplete message.\n\nBut he knew what Wei Ling Yang wanted to say.\n\nWei Ling Yang wanted him to try and catch up with them!\n\nIn the star cloud storm, Wei Ling Yang could not stay behind or even have any strength to reinforce Bi Chen Tian. Because around him, Canary Pavilion also needed to be taken care of.\n\nBi Chen Tian had to rely on himself.\n\n“Let’s do it.” Bi Chen Tian shouted, his eyes shone with endless brilliance, his rank eight aura surged like a tornado.\n\nWind Sweeping Building shone with a jade green light, which quickly turned into fierce winds rapidly.\n\nThe winds moved and howled shrilly.\n\nThese deep green colored winds joined together, forming into a strong and sturdy tornado pillar.\n\nImmortal Gu House Wind Sweeping Building stabilized, the surrounding stars were all pushed away by the wind pillar.\n\n“This is Wind Sweeping Building’s strongest method!” Yu Yi Ye Zi was roused, his eyes shone with light as he said excitedly.\n\nWind Sweeping Building was at the center of the wind pillar, it was completely peaceful here, as if they had left the terrible tsunami and landed on a shore.\n\nThe Gu Immortals inside Wind Sweeping Building erupted into cheers.\n\nZhao Lian Yun had just crawled up from the floor when a huge star crashed into the tornado wind pillar, before breaking in and assaulting Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nAt the crucial moment, Bi Chen Tian had a timely response, he controlled Wind Sweeping Building and lowered their altitude.\n\nThis huge star grazed past Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nSome Gu Immortals by the window could see that at the moment near collision, the star had countless holes on the surface, they could be seen due to the close proximity.\n\nThe Gu Immortals who were normally graceful and elegant screamed again, they were like mortals who were experiencing natural disasters.\n\nWind Sweeping Building moved with difficulty inside the star cloud storm.\n\nEven though this Immortal Gu House used its strongest method, against the star cloud storm, it was not enough.\n\nSome huge stars approached forcefully, directly crashing into the tornado wind pillar.\n\nAnd between the stars, there was a chaotic magnetic field, these fields repelled, attracted, and crushed Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nWind Sweeping Building had to dodge those stars while under the might of these magnetic fields, thankfully it was the rank eight Gu Immortal Bi Chen Tian holding the fort, any rank seven Gu Immortal would falter for sure.\n\nHowever, even Bi Chen Tian was covered in sweat, his rank eight immortal essence was rapidly expended, his expenditure far surpassed any battle he had ever had.\n\n“This will not do, this star cloud storm is too huge, I do not know when I can escape!” Bi Chen Tian had a thought as he ordered for the Gu Immortals to send their immortal essence into Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nThe Gu Immortals quickly contributed their efforts, including Zhao Lian Yun.\n\nShe had a phantom aperture, but she had refined immortal essence stones before and accumulated some immortal essence.\n\nBoom! Boom! Boom!\n\nFrom time to time, huge stars would crash into the wind pillar, most would be dodged by Wind Sweeping Building, but some still hit.\n\nThe magnetic fields were everywhere, like a cruel giant toying around with Wind Sweeping Building.\n\nInside the Immortal Gu House, the Gu Immortals did not speak, they were infusing their immortal essence into Wind Sweeping Building wholeheartedly.\n\nThe atmosphere was tense.\n\nEvery time a giant star crashed, many Gu Immortals’ bodies shook.\n\nZhao Lian Yun’s heart was in trepidation. She had never been faced with such danger, she would not be surprised if she died at the next moment.\n\n“Hong Yun, Hong Yun…” She thought of Ma Hong Yun’s name, each time she mentally muttered it, her heart returned to peace slightly.\n\nAfter countless times, Zhao Lian Yun’s mental state became completely peaceful.\n\n“Hong Yun, you had once risked your life for me, do you know? I am doing the same now.”\n\n“Even if I die here, I have no regrets. I am coming to save you!”\n\n“When I meet you, I will tell you that the starlight here is very fierce and dangerous beyond your imagination, it is not romantic at all.”\n\nIn a daze, Zhao Lian Yun recalled the past.\n\nAt that time, Zhao Lian Yun’s father had died in the battlefield, she was all alone, forced to marry someone else, she had to rely on Ma Hong Yun.\n\nOn a small mound.\n\nIt was night time, Ma Hong Yun was lying on the grassland with her.\n\n“Lady Xiao Yun, quickly look, it’s a meteor shower!” Ma Hong Yun pointed at the sky as he shouted.\n\n“Boring, you brought me here to see this?” Zhao Lian Yun rolled her eyes: “What is so nice about this?”\n\n“Guh.” Ma Hong Yun scratched his head: “I don’t find it nice either, but they said that to make a girl happy, I need to watch a meteor shower with her. At this time, in Northern Plains, we can often see meteor showers at night.”\n\nZhao Lian Yun mentally sighed, thinking: “I am so old already, I am afraid only young girls would like this. Hmm? Wait a minute, my body is still young, I am still a young girl.”\n\nAt this time, Ma Hong Yun asked: “Lady Xiao Yun, after looking at this meteor shower, has your mood improved?”\n\nZhao Lian Yun mentally sighed once again, she said in a coaxing tone: “I am much better now, I am so happy, look, this meteor shower is so beautiful, huh.”\n\nMa Hong Yun’s body shook, he quickly waved his hand: “Lady Xiao Yun, don’t say that, I am getting goosebumps.”\n\nZhao Lian Yun stood up in an instant, stomping at Ma Hong Yun: “Learning how to woo women out of all things, and you want to flirt with me, you are actually flirting with me.”\n\nMa Hong Yun was screaming out in pain from getting kicked, shouting: “Lady Xiao Yun, stop, stop it! What is flirting? I have done no such thing. If I did something wrong, I will change it, okay? Stop kicking, stop kicking me!”\n\nZhao Lian Yun ignored him as Ma Hong Yun rolled around from getting kicked. Eventually, Zhao Lian Yun worked up a sweat, she placed her arms at her waist as she looked at the scurrying Ma Hong Yun, laughing smugly.\n\nMa Hong Yun heard her laughter and thought: “Lady Xiao Yun is finally laughing, at expected, the meteor shower made her mood better. Gasp… but it is so painful for me.”\n\nHer memories flashed right before Zhao Lian Yun’s eyes.\n\nUnknowingly, Zhao Lian Yun had started smiling.\n\n“Hong Yun, after I save you, I will kick you countless times to celebrate it.” Zhao Lian Yun thought. Right at this time, love Gu inside her phantom aperture actually emitted a profound aura on its own.\n\nThe aura was colorless and formless, it spread rapidly.\n\nOrdinary Gu Immortals could not sense it, but Bi Chen Tian’s body shook, his eyes shone with brilliance, he subconsciously thought: “Is this the power of love Gu?”"
