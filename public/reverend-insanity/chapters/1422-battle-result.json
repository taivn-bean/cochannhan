Myriad dragon killer move was amplified by his transformation path, sword path, and other dao marks, its power reached the very limit of a rank seven killer move.\n\nThe dragons attacked the four song warriors fiercely.\n\nThe green jade song warrior was surrounded by countless crumbling jade dragons, but it was unable to hold on for long as it got drowned in sword dragons.\n\nThe heaven and earth song warrior attacked grandly with overwhelming pressure, but the dragons were too numerous, it was eventually eaten by one of them.\n\nThe submission song warrior lasted the longest, it managed to make some of the ancient sword dragon clones submit to it, but it could not turn this situation around.\n\nAnd finally, the separation song warrior separated some ancient sword dragon clones, it charged out but was still surrounded by more sword dragons, it could not resist the tide of endless waves of dragons.\n\nAll along, Fang Yuan’s myriad self had been high in quantity and low in quality. Especially against Gu Immortal experts, it was useless. As Fang Yuan’s enemies got stronger, myriad self had turned into a method for him to escape while using familiar face.\n\nBut now, after creating this combination move, using myriad self on top of ancient sword dragon transformation, the effect had been elevated to achieve a qualitative change.\n\nAncient sword dragon transformation used rank seven dragon breath Immortal Gu and dragon scale Immortal Gu, as well as rank six dragon strength Immortal Gu, he had the constitution of an ancient desolate beast.\n\nThe clones of the ancient sword dragon were not comparable with the myriad self killer move clones at all!\n\nThis was the strongest attacking method that Fang Yuan currently possessed.\n\nThe myriad dragons engulfed the four song warriors, before encircling Feng Jiu Ge tightly.\n\nFang Yuan did not hesitate, he directly mobilized the dragon group, attacking Feng Jiu Ge from all directions.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s admiration faded from his gaze as he clenched his right fist and punched forward.\n\nBang!\n\nA loud drum sound shook heaven and earth, it was like rumbling thunder, five or six ancient sword dragon clones were destroyed.\n\nAt almost the same time, Feng Jiu Ge’s left hand palm slapped towards the side.\n\nDing!\n\nThe chimes of the bell caused several ancient sword dragons to stop their movement, before their bodies shook and they disintegrated into nothingness after a breath’s time.\n\nDrum fist!\n\nBell palm!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge continued to attack, there were unceasing sounds as he attacked to defend himself, forcing the ancient sword dragons to stay away from him.\n\nMyriad dragon could send most rank seven Gu Immortals in this world into mortal danger. But against Feng Jiu Ge, it was not enough.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s accumulation of sound path dao marks was simply too deep, even inside the anti-sound desert, his power could not be fully suppressed.\n\nBut Fang Yuan felt some surprise upon seeing this.\n\n“It is a bit strange.”\n\n“Why is Feng Jiu Ge not using yang pass tune?”\n\n“In this situation, the song warriors are already destroyed, Feng Jiu Ge can totally move away and avoid my attacks, he would be able to expend less immortal essence at a steady rate.”\n\n“Unless he is preparing a certain immortal killer move…”\n\n“But he is using drum fist and bell palm already, there is a low possibility of him using other killer moves. And he is not going to use a killer move under such a dangerous situation, right?”\n\n“This means, there is likely to be one reason. The information in the five hundred years of my previous life was not without reason, it seems.”\n\nAll sorts of thoughts collided and sparked in Fang Yuan’s mind.\n\nAt the next moment, he turned back to human and told the Shadow Sect immortals: “We will retreat!”\n\nAncient battle formation Omni-directional Travel activated again as Feng Jiu Ge smiled bitterly, watching Fang Yuan and the others leave without giving chase.\n\nIt turned out that even though his movement killer move, yang pass tune, was very superb, it could even contain a variation move, song warrior, it had one weakness.\n\nThat was a time limit.\n\nEach activation of yang pass tune lasted a limited amount of time.\n\nOnce it was up, yang pass tune’s effect would vanish, and Feng Jiu Ge would only be able to use it after fourteen hours.\n\nThus, for Feng Jiu Ge, this was a very precious immortal killer move, he would not use it casually in normal battles.\n\nBecause once he used the killer move, he would be faced with a time limit.\n\nOnce he could not end the battle within the time limit, Feng Jiu Ge would not have a better movement method to leave the battlefield.\n\nIn the battle with Wu Yong earlier, Clear Jade Dripping Wind Tiny Bamboo Building was too fast, even if Feng Jiu Ge used yang pass tune, he could not escape.\n\nEarlier when chasing Fang Yuan, because he used Omni-directional Travel, Feng Jiu Ge had to use yang pass tune to catch up.\n\nWhen Fang Yuan used myriad dragon, yang pass tune’s time limit was up, Feng Jiu Ge could only smile bitterly in his heart as he used drum fist and bell palm to defend against myriad dragon.\n\nAfter Fang Yuan and the rest left, myriad dragon slowly faded away.\n\nIn the huge battlefield, only Feng Jiu Ge was left.\n\nHe was completely unharmed, he was still graceful and elegant, as if he had not fought in the battle earlier.\n\nFang Yuan successfully retreated, Feng Jiu Ge did not feel dejected, he even smiled lightly.\n\n“Fighting with Fang Yuan, how can it be settled in one battle?”\n\n“There has to be lots of probing, after finding out all his trump cards, I will be able to kill him. But before that, there is Heavenly Court’s mission to force Fang Yuan and give us a chance of destroying Red Lotus’ true inheritance.”\n\n“Fang Yuan seems to know a lot about me, is it because of Spring Autumn Cicada?”\n\n“That new female immortal looks like Fairy Cui Bo from Western Desert, but she uses soul path methods, it is quite strange.”\n\nThe result of his probing was very fruitful.\n\nEspecially regarding Ying Wu Xie.\n\nIn the previous fight, because of Fang Yuan’s ample arrangements, Feng Jiu Ge did not notice Fairy Cui Bo.\n\nBut now was different.\n\n“Ying Wu Xie has lead soul into dream, he is the greatest threat, Fang Yuan might have the move now, but it could also be with Ying Wu Xie.”\n\n“In this battle, there was no Ying Wu Xie, but there was a new member, Fairy Cui Bo.”\n\n“If I remember correctly, Fairy Cui Bo is the concubine of Thousand Transformations Ancestor, why is she hanging out with Fang Yuan now?”\n\n“Is it because Fairy Cui Bo is a member of Shadow Sect, or did she… get possessed by Ying Wu Xie?”\n\nEven though Feng Jiu Ge was not a wisdom path Gu Immortal, he was intelligent and nearly reached the truth in a short amount of time.\n\nAnd at the other side.\n\n“Feng Jiu Ge indeed didn’t chase us.” Fang Yuan looked at the sky, even though his retreat had elements of probing, he had already obtained the truth.\n\nYang pass tune had a time limit.\n\nAfter knowing this, the other Shadow Sect Gu Immortals let out a sigh of relief.\n\n“Feng Jiu Ge is powerful, true to his reputation!”\n\n“I can feel that he has methods left, he has not used all his trump cards.”\n\n“All in all, this was just a test run, we did not use our trump cards either, right?”\n\nThe Gu Immortals conversed.\n\nIt was indeed so.\n\nBe it Black Tigress’ tiger lick killer move, or Bai Ning Bing’s Bai Xiang, or Ying Wu Xie’s lead soul into dream, they were not used.\n\nIn this battle, both sides reserved strength, but they also used many of their methods.\n\nLike Feng Jiu Ge’s yang pass tune, song warrior, and Fang Yuan’s myriad dragon.\n\nWhen they fight again, these killer moves would be countered, or at least, they would be defended against.\n\nSeveral days later, on an ordinary sand dune.\n\nThe wind of the desert blew up clouds of sand and smoke.\n\nThe sun was setting, the clouds were red like blood.\n\nCamel bells rang with the wind, far away, there was a merchant caravan made by a group of mortal Gu Masters.\n\nThese people were naturally unable to detect Fang Yuan and gang.\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan’s consciousness was in his immortal aperture.\n\nAn immortal Gu formation was set up in Mini Central Continent.\n\nSelf cleansing immortal Gu formation!\n\nUsing self love Immortal Gu as the core of the rank seven Gu formation, and formation flag Immortal Gu as the supplement, once activated, it would cleanse all of the harmful dao marks constantly. And because of formation flag Immortal Gu, this immortal Gu formation could be moved temporarily.\n\nThat was to say, when Fang Yuan wanted to, he could take out this immortal formation and use it himself.\n\nIf he did not need to use it, he could place it back into the sovereign immortal aperture, it was very convenient.\n\n“This immortal formation has a lot of room for improvement. For example, I can add time path Gu worms to increase the rate of time. Unfortunately, my time path attainment level is too low, I cannot make deductions on that.”\n\nFang Yuan felt it was a pity.\n\n“However, I am at least able to relocate the formation spirit over to become the formation spirit of this immortal formation.”\n\nThis was not strange.\n\nFang Yuan only needed to combine that incomplete immortal formation with the self cleansing immortal formation.\n\nAnd this was a type of immortal killer move technique, combination move.\n\nFang Yuan was skilled in this and was a formation path grandmaster.\n\nHe was very confident in this, he estimated that three days was all he needed.\n\n“With the formation spirit, I will not need to activate the immortal Gu formation myself, I can spend my time and energy on other things.”\n\n“But before that, I need to elevate myriad self to another level first!”\n\nWhen he fought against Feng Jiu Ge in the anti-sound desert, Fang Yuan gained a huge amount of inspiration.\n\nThat was the elevation of immortal killer move myriad self!\n\nAt the same time.\n\n“This is a dream realm indeed!”\n\n“But husband’s will, rank eight Immortal Gu Mutation, and Dancer Hong Yun, are they still inside?”\n\nIn the air, two rank seven female immortals looked at each other.\n\nThey were Thousand Transformations Ancestor’s concubines, one was called Night Temptress, the other was Immortal Concubine Qing Lan.\n\nDancer Hong Yun and his will were trapped, Thousand Transformations Ancestor naturally felt it. Not long ago, he received information that Fang Yuan and the others had plotted against him and even possessed Fairy Cui Bo.\n\nThousand Transformations Ancestor was furious, but because his injuries were not healed yet, and without actual facts, he sent his two concubines to investigate it.\n\nBe it Night Temptress or Immortal Concubine Qing Lan, they were rank seven experts, but against the dream realm, they were helpless.\n\nWhen they were feeling lost, a mysterious voice entered their heads: “If you cannot explore the dream realm, why don’t you find the culprit, Fairy Cui Bo is with them.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Come out!”\n\nThe two female immortals shouted, they used their investigative methods but they could not find the source of the voice.\n\n“Such impressive sound path methods.” The expressions of Night Temptress and Immortal Concubine Qing Lan changed."
