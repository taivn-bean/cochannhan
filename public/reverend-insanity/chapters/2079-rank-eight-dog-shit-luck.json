They even tried to interfere and support Chi Xu Zhi when I was about to take my position. Ever since that damned Chi Xu Zhi married a female immortal of Ba clan, his ambition has been rising day by day.” Chi Bang’s tone was filled with hatred as he recalled.\n\nHe slammed the table: “I have decided to agree with Wu clan’s alliance, as for Ba clan… I will send a letter of explanation and hope they can understand.”\n\nThe news of Chi Bang’s agreement to cooperate reached Wu Yong.\n\nWu Yong laughed heartily: “This young Chi Bang is no cause for concern!”\n\nClearly, Wu Yong’s plan was working smoothly.\n\nWith Chi Qu You dead, Chi clan’s internal structure was weak. Ba clan had a change of leadership, the previous first supreme elder, Ba Shi Ba, was captured by Fang Yuan and lost his immortal aperture as well as his cultivation. After Ba De took his position, Ba clan became unstable.\n\nWu Yong intuitively sensed the crack in these two clans. The incident regarding the Roar inheritance was like a heaven-sent opportunity to Wu Yong, how could he not grasp it?\n\n“Good news, I have good news.” At this time, Wu Ba Chong suddenly came before the door and sought an audience.\n\n“Come in.” Wu Yong said: “What’s the news?”\n\nHe rarely saw the stable Wu Ba Chong express such joy.\n\nWu Ba Chong said: “When Wu Bei was exploring Space Comprehension Pit, he unexpectedly discovered a large amount of dry clear qi!”\n\nWu Yong was slightly dazed before applauding: “This is indeed good news.”\n\nWu Du Xiu had three regrets in her life.\n\nThe first was the group, Fierce Gorge Seven Ghosts, that Wu Yong had already eliminated. Second was she was not able to refine eight-faced prestige wind Gu.\n\nWu clan had been gathering immortal materials for eight-faced prestige wind Immortal Gu for many years, and only lacked one main material: dry clear qi.\n\nWu Bei unexpectedly obtained dry clear qi this time, which was enough for Wu clan to refine eight-faced prestige wind Gu.\n\n“Wu Bei is indeed my clan’s lucky star. Reward him!” Wu Yong quickly thought before speaking.\n\n“Eight-faced prestige wind Gu is a rank eight Immortal Gu, it is a major matter if we are to refine it, we must treat it seriously and make many preparations. Everyone in Wu clan needs to give their all for this refinement.” As Wu Yong said this, he sighed: “Refining rank eight Immortal Gu is difficult, truly difficult! Even Fang Yuan, with Lang Ya blessed land’s help, will struggle with refining rank eight Gu. This is a serious matter, we might have all the immortal materials but we need to consider this carefully.”\n\nWu Ba Chong’s excited state slowly calmed down.\n\n“Lord is right, I was too rash.”\n\nWu Yong was able to maintain calm and logic, Wu Ba Chong felt even more admiration towards him.\n\nWu Yong said: “We will put aside refining eight-faced prestige wind Gu for now. Chi Bang has already agreed to ally with us, what we need to do now is to pressure Ba clan and make them unable to interfere in this matter.”\n\nWu Yong took precautions and thought of everything, he had already started to get rid of this future obstacle in advance.\n\nIt was another round of planning and arrangements.\n\nWu Ba Chong left the study room while praising inwardly: “Lord Wu Yong has both battle strength and a strategic mind, would my Wu clan even have to worry about not accomplishing great things under his lead?”\n\nDays later, in the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nFang Yuan’s time path clone was controlling Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool.\n\n“Rise!” The time path clone shouted, rank eight immortal essence poured in crazily.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe blood-like water in the square pool suddenly rose towards the sky like a reverse waterfall.\n\nThe whole Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool began making noises, it was activated to its limit.\n\nThe blood waterfall rose in the air and formed a whirlpool at the top.\n\nThe whirlpool rotated rapidly while letting out brilliant radiance.\n\nAfter the whirlpool absorbed a large amount of blood water, it gradually calmed down.\n\nFinally, an Immortal Gu flew out of the whirlpool.\n\nThe whirlpool dissipated, the reverse flowing blood waterfall also fell down to the square pool; only some blood water remained in the pool.\n\nBlood red light retreated like birds returning to their nest, to the top of the small pavilion in the pool. That was the position of blood asset Immortal Gu.\n\nFang Yuan’s time path clone regulated his breath for a while before moving his will. The Immortal Gu that was floating in the air flew into his palm.\n\nThis Immortal Gu looked like a dung beetle.\n\nIts whole body was golden yellow, it had three parts to its body; head, stomach, and tail. its head was like a crescent shovel which had paddle like tentacles in its sides. Its stomach had a horizontal ridge, and its tail was oval.\n\nIt had two pairs of legs and a pair of tails. Every tentacle was rough and thick, and had hard black barbs on their ends.\n\nIt was dog shit luck Immortal Gu; after having gone through Fang Yuan’s refinement, it had advanced to rank eight.\n\nDog shit luck Immortal Gu was the core Immortal Gu of Cooking Luck Pot.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable created luck path and left three great true inheritances: Self luck, all living beings luck, and heaven and earth luck. Cooking Luck Pot was the peak creation of the essence of self luck true inheritance.\n\nBefore the fate war, Fang Yuan had thrown in almost all his luck path Immortal Gu into Cooking Luck Pot.\n\nThis time, he dismantled Cooking Luck Pot and advanced the rank of all its luck path Immortal Gu.\n\nDog shit luck Immortal Gu was the primary target, but Fang Yuan succeeded in his first attempt at refinement.\n\nFour Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool had fifty to sixty percent success rate even when refining rank eight Immortal Gu. This was such a terrifying success rate that if news about it were to spread, it would shake the whole Gu Immortal world; it might even lead to crazed attacks by Longevity Heaven and Heavenly Court.\n\nWith rank eight Dog Shit Luck, Cooking Luck Pot’s rank had already advanced to rank eight.\n\nIf one were an ordinary Gu Immortal, they would stop here. But Fang Yuan was far from being satisfied, he would now advance qi luck Immortal Gu, connect luck Immortal Gu, luck plan Immortal Gu, luck inspection Immortal Gu, and so on.\n\nThe time path clone maintained the activation of Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool.\n\nFollowing the rapid expenditure of rank eight immortal essence, the almost used up pool water began to fill up again.\n\nThis pool water was the refinement water of the incomplete Refinement Sea which was mixed with the water of the River of Time, and had gone through refinement path methods using water refinement Immortal Gu as the core, to form this wonderful creation.\n\nThe time path clone opened the hidden door of the Immortal Gu House’s storage, the luck path immortal materials inside began to fall into the pool.\n\nAmong them was the favored heart.\n\nFang Yuan had already brought back Lady White Rabbit and Fairy Miao Yin.\n\nWhat he used was a killer move involving Fixed Immortal Travel.\n\nThe killer move Jade flow pearl was no longer suitable for the current Fang Yuan because of his enormous dao marks.\n\nBut it was of no issue, Fang Yuan had created many compound killer moves and had already created the new heaven and earth travel killer move!\n\nWith the help of over nine thousand heaven path dao marks, heaven and earth travel directly sent Fang Yuan to the nearby Earth Treasury.\n\nIn the heart of the mighty earth vein, Fang Yuan withstood the strong pressure leisurely and stored the whole Earth Treasury into his immortal aperture.\n\nBai Ning Bing had already left secretly but Fang Yuan did not care about her. There was clearly no reason to waste time on her at this moment.\n\nAfter refining dog shit luck Immortal Gu, rank nine luck path immortal material favored heart shrunk a little. Another layer of its surface was refined and merged into the pool water.\n\nSuch usage of immortal materials had already reached the peak of brilliance.\n\nBlood red light once again spread from blood asset Immortal Gu and covered the whole pool.\n\nThe pool water billowed, the immortal materials inside it melted and mixed with the blood water.\n\nAfter a while, everything was in place. Four Elements Square Regret Blood Refinement Pool’s efficiency in processing immortal materials was astonishing.\n\nThe time path clone threw luck inspection Immortal Gu into the water.\n\nThe second round of refinement had begun!\n\nImmemorial black heaven, Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace.\n\nA tribulation had just dissipated in Hei Lou Lan’s blessed land.\n\nHei Lou Lan revealed joy at the impressive gains of this tribulation. She could not have passed it alone, but with Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s guidance and Bing Sai Chuan’s protection, she easily succeeded.\n\n“It has not been long since I came to Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace, but over this period, I have already gone through many calamities and tribulations; my strength has been increasing rapidly day by day.”\n\n“My previous feeling was not wrong, it seems Longevity Heaven really wants to heavily nurture me!”\n\nHei Lou Lan inspected her immortal aperture.\n\nAfter she came and met Immortal Zombie Giant Sun for the first time, Bing Sai Chuan used time path methods to increase her immortal aperture’s time flow to an astonishing level.\n\nAt the same time, Longevity Heaven supported her with an endless stream of strength path immortal materials. There was simply no hidden threat of advancing too rapidly.\n\nWith such an abundant amount of strength path immortal materials, it would naturally attract strength path calamities and tribulations.\n\nLongevity Heaven held the strongest luck path methods in the world which were extremely helpful in undergoing tribulations. Hei Lou Lan only had to sit back and enjoy the spoils.\n\nWith the support of the second largest super force in the world and being valued highly by Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, Hei Lou Lan deeply felt the advantage of relying on a force.\n\nShe did not need to worry about nurturing and refining Gu, and also did not need to go gather Gu recipes, killer moves and so on; someone would directly send them to her.\n\nEven the management of immortal aperture and the arrangement of resource points were planned for her by specialized wisdom path Gu Immortals.\n\nHei Lou Lan only needed to ponder on the usage of Gu and train her killer moves.\n\nAlthough she was a descendant of the venerable, her life was full of hurdles, and after meeting Fang Yuan, she had to endure even more hardship and face life and death situations many times. So, after obtaining the huge support, besides being extremely thankful, she cherished this opportunity even more so!\n\nShe was deeply aware of how precious such an opportunity was and how difficult it was to come by.\n\nShe cherished every minute and every second of her time, and besides the necessary rest, she cultivated hard every day.\n\nOnce in a while, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun would summon her to evaluate and guide her.\n\nThis time when he called for her, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was no longer able to watch Hei Lou Lan train in such a self-damaging way, he urged: “Hei Lou Lan, my descendant. Don’t be overly harsh on yourself, everything in the world emphasizes on balance between work and rest. Gu Immortal cultivation is also the same. If you carry on like this and stay in a tensed state all the time, it will instead be harmful.”\n\nHei Lou Lan faced Giant Sun immortal zombie but still insisted on her thoughts: “Lord ancestor, the toughness I am experiencing is not too much to handle. In the past, I cultivated beside Fang Yuan and saw the effort he made. The world thinks he got his current accomplishments because of the help that venerables gave. But in my opinion, even if no one helped him, based on his character, he would still be able to stand out and wreak havoc in a region.”\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun was slightly stunned before smiling, appreciating Hei Lou Lan even more: “Looks like you are regarding Fang Yuan as your enemy and the goal to surpass. Good, with such determination and spirit, you are worthy of being my, Giant Sun’s, descendant!”\n\n“But, it will be very difficult for you to surpass Fang Yuan, it is simply like a mortal trying to ascend to heaven. I won’t conceal it from you, Fang Yuan’s strength has been increasing rapidly in this period of time, the speed is extremely astonishing.”\n\nHei Lou Lan looked at Giant Sun immortal zombie doubtfully.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun explained: “Although luck inspection Immortal Gu is no longer with me, Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace contains similar luck inspection killer moves, moreover because it has been here for too long, all the luck of the five regions and two heavens are in my sight.”\n\n“Recently, I have been looking at Eastern Sea repeatedly, over at Xia clan’s headquarters, the luck has been rising constantly and fiercely, even I have rarely seen such a case in my life.”\n\n“Spectral Soul, Heavenly Court, and my Calamity Luck Altar failed to kill Fang Yuan, finally giving him the chance to develop. He obtained the help of several venerables and has excellent character, as well as plenty of experiences from several rebirths. The more time he has, the stronger he will grow. If you want to catch up to him, you will only have a trace of hope if you make a desperate effort.”\n\nHei Lou Lan’s expression was serious as she asked firmly: “Please instruct me, Ancestor, what way is there?”\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable shook his head slightly: “It is not time yet, continue to cultivate hard for now.”"
