Without getting past this, there was no way of defeating Fang Yuan.\n\nThus, Feng Jiu Ge controlled the green jade song warrior mainly to distract Fang Yuan.\n\nThe green jade song warrior was like a fly moving around Fang Yuan, disrupting his movements.\n\nAfter a while, Fang Yuan could not take the disturbance anymore and turned around to deal with the green jade song warrior.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s pupils shrank, Fang Yuan had changed targets too quickly, but Feng Jiu Ge responded rapidly as well.\n\nFang Yuan arrived at the green jade song warrior!\n\nThe huge ancient sword dragon body against the small green jade song warrior.\n\nThe dragon roared as intense winds blew, its ruthless dragon claws slashed at the green jade song warrior.\n\nCracks started to surface on the green jade song warrior’s body, there was a crisp sound as it was sent flying like a cannonball.\n\nBut the green jade song warrior was not on the verge of breaking down yet, it was still able to fight.\n\n“Crafty.” Fang Yuan snorted coldly.\n\nIn the earlier skirmish, the green jade song warrior did not attack, it was taking hits passively. Thus, reverse flow protection seal could not reflect any attacks back to it, just the ancient sword dragon’s claws alone could not shatter the green jade song warrior.\n\nAfter all, Feng Jiu Ge had rank eight level dao marks, the green jade song warrior’s defense was at the top of his song warriors.\n\nAfter sending the green jade song warrior flying, Fang Yuan turned to Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nBut at this time, Feng Jiu Ge had already unleashed his second song warrior — Heaven and Earth Song Warrior.\n\nAfter dozens of rounds, Feng Jiu Ge continued to dodge with yang pass tune, while summoning song warriors to fight Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan fought against five enemies, but he was still energetic and full of fighting spirit, Feng Jiu Ge could not help but retreat continuously.\n\n“What is going on?”\n\n“Fang Yuan was at his limit activating reverse flow protection seal last time.”\n\n“But now, he can maintain both reverse flow protection seal and ancient sword dragon transformation, while fighting for such a long time, and he is still not at his limit?”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge had a deep gaze, he purposely used song warrior to create a complex battle environment so that Fang Yuan would need to think constantly and expend his thoughts to deal with these problems.\n\nIf Fang Yuan was barely using these two killer moves, he would not have enough thoughts in his mind, he would not be able to display such great strength now.\n\n“This means, he had an incredible breakthrough in terms of sustaining killer moves?” Feng Jiu Ge guessed.\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan’s body shook.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was paying great attention to Fang Yuan, he saw this and turned joyful: “Don’t tell me, he reached his limit?”\n\nBut at the next moment, Feng Jiu Ge tossed this thought away into the bin.\n\nBecause Fang Yuan activated immortal killer move — Myriad Dragon!\n\nAt once, dragons flew and formed into a silvery sea, their aura was grand and imposing, it was a terrifying sight.\n\nA scene similar to earlier appeared again.\n\nMyriad dragons flew as the four song warriors were encircled and attacked.\n\nThe four song warriors were outmatched and destroyed.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge ignored them, he used yang pass tune to escape from the myriad dragons’ range.\n\nYang pass tune’s time limit was not up yet, Feng Jiu Ge had a lot of room to maneuver.\n\n“Then what about this move?” He looked at the myriad dragon group, Fang Yuan was mixed inside, he could not be found.\n\nNext, Feng Jiu Ge placed his right palm on his left chest, by his heart. Next, his five fingers strung on his chest, creating light and deep drumming sounds.\n\nThud thud thud…\n\nThe drumming continued, spreading to the entire battlefield.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge did not need to discern who Fang Yuan was among the dragons. Because this immortal killer move was an area attack, it had a huge range.\n\nFang Yuan was within the range of the attack, he was immediately affected, his heart started pounding as he felt his momentum going out of control.\n\nFang Yuan was shocked.\n\nAfter all, he had reverse flow protection seal’s defense, but he could not block this immortal killer move.\n\n“No, most of the effect of the killer move was reflected back, only a small bit penetrated the seal and got to me. It seems that Heavenly Court has obtained some gains in deciphering reverse flow protection seal killer move.”\n\nFang Yuan sighed internally.\n\nThere was no helping it, he had already used reverse flow protection seal multiple times, Heavenly Court had wisdom path great experts like Fairy Zi Wei, together with Star Constellation Chessboard, it was not strange she had such advancement.\n\nBoom boom boom.\n\nFollowing the loud sounds, the dragons around Fang Yuan started to self-detonate, exploding into nothingness.\n\n“This immortal killer move chaotic heart drumming sound was given to me by Heavenly Court, it has wisdom path effects. Once hit by it, the Gu Immortal’s thoughts will be disrupted, their killer moves would not be sustainable. Fang Yuan, how long can you last?” Feng Jiu Ge was in anticipation.\n\n“An impressive killer move, it was designed to target me.” Fang Yuan considered the effects of this incredible move.\n\nRight now, in the sovereign immortal aperture, large numbers of human shaped myriad self clones were self-detonating, the number of clones destroyed surpassed the number of his myriad dragons.\n\nLooking at them, the myriad self clones were different from before.\n\nTheir appearance was much more lively, and they even had vivid expressions.\n\nAt this moment, they were sitting on the ground, thinking deeply.\n\nAfter being hit by chaotic heart drumming sound, these myriad self clones self-detonated as they turned into white smoke and faded.\n\n“After adding in self will, these myriad self clones gained wisdom path cognition, but this made them susceptible to Feng Jiu Ge’s killer move.”\n\nFang Yuan placed a portion of his attention into the sovereign immortal aperture, looking at his losses.\n\nAlmost every breath of time, dozens of myriad self clones died.\n\n“However, these vanishing myriad self clones were not harmed by Feng Jiu Ge’s killer move. Most of them died from sustaining my reverse flow protection seal and ancient sword dragon transformation. When I activated myriad dragon earlier, a thousand of my myriad self clones died after all.”\n\nThat’s right.\n\nThe reason why Fang Yuan was able to use reverse flow protection seal along with other killer moves was because of these myriad self clones in the sovereign immortal aperture.\n\nAll along, Fang Yuan had been troubled by this, even though reverse flow protection seal was powerful, it took too much of his concentration and mental energy.\n\nWhile fighting against Feng Jiu Ge, he was inspired by song warrior, he had an idea.\n\n“I also have myriad self clones, if I can make these clones think for me, my battle strength would rise sharply!”\n\nThere were two difficulties in achieving this.\n\nThe first problem was that myriad self clones could not think. To think, he would need to use wisdom path thoughts, wills, or emotions.\n\nThe second problem was that even with a large number of thoughts, wills, and emotions, after dispersing them into his clones, it could not collectively benefit him alone.\n\nFang Yuan’s first breakthrough in this was using self love Immortal Gu and affection Immortal Gu, these two were very compatible, Fang Yuan supplemented them with a few mortal Gu to form an immortal killer move that produced a vast amount of self will!\n\nThe second difficulty was solved by Fang Yuan using a method from Purple Mountain True Monarch’s inheritance, immortal killer move — Collective Thinking!\n\nOf course, even though these two problems were solved, Fang Yuan still had to rely on his wisdom path grandmaster attainment level to modify myriad self to a whole new level.\n\n“Feng Jiu Ge, your killer move is not enough.” Fang Yuan snickered in his heart.\n\nBecause he had prepared amply before the battle.\n\nHe had prepared more than a million myriad self clones in his sovereign immortal aperture!\n\nThe death of a few thousand was inconsequential.\n\nImmortal killer move — Three Breaths Future Vision!\n\nImmortal killer move — Myriad Dragon!\n\nImmortal killer move — Sword Marks Targeting Death!\n\nAt once, the aura of countless Gu worms emerged from Fang Yuan’s body.\n\nThese auras were messy and disorganized, countless mortal Gu and a large number of Immortal Gu flew out and created a grand arrangement!\n\n“How can this be?!” Feng Jiu Ge was utterly shocked: “Fang Yuan can use so many immortal killer moves at the same time!!”\n\nHe was completely taken aback.\n\nIt was unimaginable!\n\nHe had always thought that Fang Yuan could only barely activate two or three killer moves, he was at his limit already.\n\nBut seeing this now, Feng Jiu Ge finally realized that Fang Yuan’s improvement in this aspect was so huge that it went beyond his imagination.\n\nThis weakness that Fang Yuan had earlier was no longer a weakness, it was a huge strength that he had now!\n\nThere were many clones remaining from the first myriad dragon killer move, after using it again, a silvery sea of dragons appeared again.\n\nThree breaths future vision allowed Fang Yuan to have sharp senses, while sword marks targeting death was boosted by his sword path dao marks, it was a huge threat to Feng Jiu Ge as well!\n\nFeng Jiu Ge gritted his teeth, he advanced instead of retreating, charging into the dragon group.\n\nBam bam bam…\n\nA thunderous explosion resounded in the surroundings.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge rampaged within the myriad dragon group.\n\nHe was increasingly shocked now.\n\n“It was not a fluke, Fang Yuan has complete control now, he has not even used his full strength yet! I cannot stay here, I need to leave!” While yang pass tune was still activated, Feng Jiu Ge decided to retreat.\n\nHe was actually forced to retreat by Fang Yuan alone!"
