Hmph, the amazing one is Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, you take no credit in this!”\n\nLiu Hui sneered: “Then what about earlier when our side was suppressed by fate? Moreover, who cares about who the credit belongs to? Life or death, victory or defeat, these are the only important things, go die.”\n\nHe waved his hand lightly, taking the enemy’s life.\n\nHis eyes were narrow and his gaze was chilling as he sized up his surroundings with ill intentions: “Who should be next?”\n\n…\n\n“You cannot break my defense, don’t waste your effort.” A Heavenly Court Gu Immortal stood steadfast and unmoved, his whole body covered in an extremely tough barrier.\n\nNorthern Plains Gu Immortal Yu Yang Zi took in a deep breath, he felt the vast new strength in his body, his dejectedness from earlier vanished as his confidence soared: “The current me is not the same as before. Immortal killer move — Decomposition!”\n\nYu Yang Zi’s original name was Ye Lui Wa and he cultivated rule path. After becoming a Gu Immortal, he achieved remarkable feats repeatedly, but Ye Lui tribe did not give him the treatment he deserved. In a fit of anger, he defected from the tribe and became a demonic path Gu Immortal.\n\nIn his later years, Ye Lui tribe was jointly pushed aside and suppressed by many Huang Jin tribes, Ye Lui Wa who had become rank eight was welcomed back to become Ye Lui tribe’s first supreme elder in a grand manner and returned to the righteous path.\n\nHe relied on his own strength to achieve feats that was unattainable for ordinary Gu Immortals, making the entire tribe lower its head and admit its past mistake.\n\nYe Lui Wa’s life history was painted with legendary tales that stimulated countless future generations. But even after returning to Ye Lui tribe and taking the position of first supreme elder, he did not use his original name and still went by Yu Yang Zi.\n\n“How can this be?!” The Heavenly Court Gu Immortal was pale from shock, the defense that he prided himself on continued to break apart before disintegrating completely.\n\nWith the help of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, Yu Yang Zi directly reversed the position of the strong and weak.\n\nThe Heavenly Court Gu Immortal fighting against him soon died a miserable death.\n\n…\n\nChink chink chink!\n\nThree Heavenly Court immortals were fighting Yuan Ben.\n\nYuan Ben was a rank eight Gu Immortal who primarily cultivated bone path and had shocking battle strength. While he was alive, he was considered the number one battle strength in Northern Plains’ Gu Immortal world, even the other four regions often heard of his famous name.\n\nHis physique was not strong-built, instead he was slightly on the bony side. But his whole body was covered in extremely tough white bone armor. He held a white bone spear in his right hand which created a storm when he waved it, in his left hand, he held a bone sword, the sword light it gave off was cold and dark.\n\nYuan Ben roared loudly when he received a portion of the yellow light, his armor suddenly shot out countless bone spikes.\n\nOne Heavenly Court Gu Immortal who was surrounding him could not dodge in time and died miserably after being pierced by hundreds of spikes.\n\nYuan Ben took the chance to rush forward and pierced the second Gu Immortal’s heart with his spear while slicing off the third Gu Immortal’s head with his sword.\n\nBut he did not feel any excitement or joy, instead he looked slightly sad: “It is unfortunate you did not have all your Gu worms and could not display your full strength. Furthermore, I obtained ancestor’s help, this battle… there is no honor in winning!”\n\n…\n\nBoom!\n\nWith a loud bang, Duke Long was sent flying like a cannonball.\n\nDragon roars resounded as Duke Long quickly stabilized himself.\n\nSuddenly, an enormous shadow shrouded over him.\n\nDuke Long quickly raised his head and saw Calamity Luck Altar pressing down like a mountain.\n\nDuke Long gave a cold grunt and clenched his fists with no intention to dodge.\n\n“Lord Duke Long, let me lend you a hand!” Heavenly Court Gu Immortal Wu Shuang activated a killer move against Duke Long.\n\nImmortal killer move — Peerless!\n\nDuke Long took a deep breath and punched at Calamity Luck Altar.\n\nImmortal killer move — Chaotic Dragon Fist!\n\nPeerless — Chaotic Dragon Fist!!\n\nFist shadows flew and set off a violent gale. Calamity Luck Altar swayed unsteadily as it was struck by tens of millions of fist shadows.\n\n“This Duke Long is still so absurdly strong!” Bing Sai Chuan gritted his teeth.\n\nCalamity Luck Altar had also received Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s amplification, its strength had risen by several times but was still unable to suppress Duke Long.\n\nBut right at this time, a giant flew over and joined the battlefield.\n\nIt was Seven Extreme Desolation!\n\n“Die, Duke Long!” The Seven Extreme Desolation giant roared as it spat out countless pitch-black needles that shot towards Duke Long.\n\n“Damn it!” Heavenly Court Gu Immortal Wu Shuang stared with a furious expression, he wanted to help but was blocked by other Northern Plains Gu Immortals.\n\nNorthern Plains Gu Immortals had rich battle experiences, and these Gu Immortals summoned by call of the ancient were experts of their eras. After fighting for so long, they were already able to tacitly coordinate.\n\nDuke Long was using chaotic dragon fist to block Calamity Luck Altar but suffered from Seven Extreme Desolation’s attack at the same time.\n\nThese pitch-black needles were extremely powerful and had explosive momentum, Duke Long felt a chilling sensation of pain before they even touched him.\n\nA sharp light flashed past Duke Long’s eyes.\n\nImmortal killer move — Clear Dragon Vision.\n\nWith the activation of the investigative killer move, he immediately saw through many details of the pitch-black needles and knew this move contained the essence of dark path and was used to counter defensive methods. If he only used his dragon scales or nine dragons protection, he would probably have countless holes in his body and be heavily injured!\n\n“Then let’s use offense against offense!” Duke Long opened his mouth and breathed out heavily.\n\nQi currents surged as they instantly formed an immortal killer move!\n\nImmortal killer move — Qi Current Scissors!\n\nCountless white qi currents charged towards the pitch-black needles.\n\nQi currents cut through the air like sharp blades, cutting apart all the black needles in their path.\n\nQi current scissors collided with pitch-black needles, each side dissipated by more than half of their original quantity.\n\nBut there were some that escaped the collision and flew towards Duke Long and Seven Extreme Desolation.\n\nAlmost at the same time, Duke Long gave a muffled grunt after being pierced by over ten pitch-black needles, while several bones and muscles of Seven Extreme Desolation’s body were cut by qi current scissors.\n\nThese injuries were shared by the Seven Big Dipper Immortals inside Seven Extreme Desolation.\n\nThey endured the pain as they coordinated their efforts in activating Seven Extreme Desolation to directly go after Duke Long.\n\nDuke Long sighed, he could only retreat!\n\nSince the battle started, this was the first time he had retreated on his own initiative.\n\nThe enemy’s momentum was so strong that Duke Long had no choice but to retreat.\n\nHis killer move heavenly dragon’s last stand could indeed let him be tyrannical among rank eights, especially during the last moments of his life, he would have complete dominance over rank eight Gu Immortals.\n\nBut, in front of a rank nine killer move, heavenly dragon’s last stand paled greatly, losing much significance.\n\nBesides the might of the killer move itself, there was also a mysterious and profound change that was occurring.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable’s attack had been an offensive killer move which originated from Northern Plains and struck Central Continent’s Heavenly Court, it crossed two regions without any decrease in its power.\n\nHeavenly Court’s own defense was extremely strong but it was not a match against Giant Sun’s attack.\n\nFortunately, during the critical moment, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable made a move and blocked Giant Sun’s attack.\n\nBut after being blocked, Giant Sun’s attack changed its nature and transformed into an amplification method which overturned the whole battle situation.\n\nThere were four main kinds of special techniques regarding the usage of killer moves: consecutive moves, variation moves, attached moves, and split moves.\n\nThe so-called variation move used a certain killer move as the base and added in new attributes to achieve a different effect. For instance, Fang Yuan’s myriad self killer move was the base for strength path giant hand.\n\nBut if Fang Yuan activated the killer move, myriad self absolutely would not transform into strength path giant hand, these two had their own differences.\n\nIn contrast, Giant Sun’s attack seemed to be able to transform at will, one moment, it was an offensive killer move, while immediately after, it became an amplification method.\n\nThe attainment that Giant Sun Immortal Venerable possessed in using the variation move technique had already surpassed Duke Long’s level of understanding!\n\n“My strength seems to be dissipating.”\n\n“Looks like Ancestor Giant Sun’s amplification cannot be maintained for long!”\n\n“We need to stop focusing on fighting, and while the amplification still exists, we need to break through the enemy’s defense line and seize fate Gu!”\n\nAs time passed, the Northern Plains Gu Immortals gradually realized something.\n\nGiant Sun’s attack transformed and became a powerful amplification method, but this strength was quickly dissipating.\n\nGiant Sun’s attack was much more explosive than heroes among people. But looking at the duration and area of coverage, heroes among people undoubtedly covered a larger area and could last for a longer time.\n\nDuke Long’s expression changed.\n\nHe was barely able to match both Calamity Luck Altar and Seven Extreme Desolation, now that Northern Plains immortals were all attacking the refinement path formation, he was simply unable to defend it.\n\nHeavenly Court Gu Immortals gathered and formed a defensive line in front of the damaged refinement formation.\n\nBut under the berserk rush of the Northern Plains Gu Immortals, the defensive line was on the verge of breaking.\n\nAll kinds of immortal killer moves collided, Gu Immortal corpses fell from the sky from time to time.\n\nBoth sides staked their lives against each other, Gu Immortal deaths rose steeply around the thin defensive line.\n\nNorthern Plains’ side was betting it all in this one fight while Heavenly Court members were defending with all their strength.\n\nBoth sides gained constant reinforcements.\n\nGu Immortals awakened from Heavenly Court immortal graveyard and rushed to the battlefield to reinforce the defensive line.\n\nWhile from the phantom image of the River of Time, Northern Plains experts stepped out and went to fight without saying a word.\n\nThe defensive line was teetering on the edge of collapsing, Fairy Zi Wei had already joined the battlefield and was using all her might to resist the Northern Plains immortals’ offense.\n\nSuddenly, a faint shadow appeared beside Fairy Zi Wei.\n\nNorthern Plains’ Gu Immortal expert Liu Liu Liu!\n\nThis person was a rank eight expert but did not have a good reputation. When he was alive, he was the only rank eight Gu Immortal in Liu tribe, and according to the customs, he should have inherited the first supreme elder’s position.\n\nBut from a young age, Liu Liu Liu had never fought openly and only bullied the weak while fearing the strong. All his attacks were usually sneak attacks.\n\nHis reputation was so bad that others could not bring themselves to respect or trust him.\n\nIf he took the position and became Liu tribe’s first supreme elder, it would instead burden the whole of Liu tribe and affect Liu tribe’s image and reputation instead.\n\nLiu Liu Liu was an anomaly and a unique existence in the history of Northern Plains. But because of this nature, he was still alive in this battlefield now."
