His grandson Feng Chan Zi was beside him, waiting for Heavenly Court’s reinforcements to no avail. The despair on Feng Chan Zi’s face became increasingly deep.\n\nOutside the central area, Eastern Sea’s rank eights completely surrounded this formation.\n\nHua clan first supreme elder Hua Cai Yun let out an immemorial cloud beast, it continued to dwindle away at the formation’s core.\n\n“This is Heavenly Court’s creation after all, even just the core of the formation can resist my cloud beast’s corrosion.” Hua Cai Yun sighed.\n\nRoar—!\n\nAt this time, a loud dragon roar could be heard from deep within the abyss, it was ground shaking.\n\nSound waves reverberated, causing the entire Earth Trench to tremor, countless rocks started to fall off the Earth Trench’s cliffs.\n\nEastern Sea’s rank eights looked at the abyss below them worriedly, Shen Cong Sheng urged: “The formation is half destroyed, it cannot suppress Di Zang Sheng anymore, to avoid problems, we need to act now.”\n\nDi Zang Sheng was a very unique legendary immemorial desolate beast. Because it was created from the power of Central Continent’s earth veins, it was born from endless hatred, anger, and grudges.\n\nThus, it bore natural hatred and killing intent towards humans, and most importantly, unless its source was destroyed, it would never die. It had once caused great trouble to Heavenly Court, Eastern Sea’s Gu Immortals did not want to fight Di Zang Sheng for no reason. They wanted to take away Dragon Palace to regain their reputation, if Di Zang Sheng was released, it would continue to find trouble with Heavenly Court and Central Continent.\n\n“It is ready.” Song Qi Yuan nodded.\n\n“Puff.” He muttered lightly.\n\nImmortal killer move — Broken Mirror Shard Light.\n\nCrack!\n\nWith a loud sound resembling a mirror falling on the ground and shattering into countless pieces.\n\nThe entire formation core area’s light halo also shattered like a mirror, exposing Old Man Bei Feng and Feng Chan Zi who were inside.\n\n“No!” Feng Chan Zi was so scared he quickly screamed and moved back.\n\nSong Qi Yuan’s killer move was very special, it created no commotion when used at first, only after a long period of nurturing would it catch people off-guard and create an unexpected result.\n\nThis broken mirror shard light was Song Qi Yuan’s proud method, it was mostly used against stationary enemies like formations.\n\nThe formation broke, Di Zang Sheng growled loudly, the sound waves created shook the entire Earth Trench.\n\n“Quick, make use of the time!” Eastern Sea’s rank eights attacked.\n\n“I am going to die!” Feng Chan Zi fell backwards, he was so scared he shut his eyes, shivering with a distorted expression, awaiting his death.\n\nOld Man Bei Feng sighed deeply, he could not fight anymore, the difference in strength was too big, he could only wait for his death.\n\n“Don’t kill him, let me capture him alive.” Shen Cong Sheng suddenly said.\n\nEastern Sea’s Gu Immortals halted their attacks, they were quite surprised, did Shen Cong Sheng have a method to capture a rank eight Gu Immortal alive?\n\n“Everyone, take a good look.” Shen Cong Sheng smiled confidently: “Go.”\n\nThe Eastern Sea immortals saw that countless threads appeared around Old Man Bei Feng’s body, he was wrapped up like a cocoon.\n\n“This is a new killer move that I created recently, it is called lingering sound!” Shen Cong Sheng explained.\n\nOld Man Bei Feng had a furious expression, he was already prepared for death, but these Eastern Sea Gu Immortals actually wanted to capture him alive, it was a great humiliation.\n\nEastern Sea’s immortals were quiet.\n\nIt seemed like Shen Cong Sheng could really capture rank eight Gu Immortals. Even though Old Man Bei Feng was defenseless at the moment, Shen Cong Sheng’s method was still quite threatening.\n\nRank eight Gu Immortals had very deep foundations, it was evident from seeing Shen Cong Sheng’s method.\n\nOld Man Bei Feng could not resist, as for Feng Chan Zi, he was already shivering from fear, Eastern Sea’s immortals did not even bother with this cowardly rank six immortal.\n\nShen Cong Sheng used his immortal killer move to its limit and captured Old Man Bei Feng. The value of a living rank eight Gu Immortal was much higher than a dead one. Forget about the rest, just the reputation gained from capturing a great expert of the same rank was enough for Shen Cong Sheng and the entire Shen clan’s reputation to soar in Eastern Sea!\n\nThe other immortals started to look for Immortal Gu House Dragon Palace.\n\nThey had come here together for this rank eight Immortal Gu House.\n\nSoon, Zhang Yin found something.\n\n“Over there!” He pointed with an excited expression, before using an investigative immortal killer move.\n\nAfter using the killer move, an Immortal Gu House appeared, it floated above everyone’s head, it was several tens of meters on top of Old Man Bei Feng.\n\nThe Eastern Sea immortals were overjoyed, what else but Dragon Palace could this be?\n\nOther than Shen Cong Sheng, the other Eastern Sea immortals quickly gathered with an excited expression.\n\nShen Cong Sheng concentrated on dealing with Old Man Bei Feng, he felt no anxiety. Before coming here, the Eastern Sea immortals had already set an alliance agreement, it had quite the binding force. The rule was: If Eastern Sea’s immortals obtain Dragon Palace, everyone would get a share. As for the share, it would depend on how much effort they put in.\n\nSince Dragon Palace appeared, Song Qi Yuan and the rest started to try and capture it.\n\nBut after using several killer moves, Dragon Palace only shook, it did not acknowledge a new owner.\n\n“This Immortal Gu House is really extraordinary!” Dragon Palace’s fierce resistance made the Eastern Sea immortals even more excited, their desire for Dragon Palace rose even more.\n\nGradually, while trying to capture it, they realized a huge secret.\n\n“So that’s it.”\n\n“Heavenly Court placed Immortal Gu House Dragon Palace here to try and tame Di Zang Sheng!”\n\n“Even though Di Zang Sheng was born from the earth vein and negative emotions, it is still considered a dragon, it is countered by Dragon Palace, thus there is a possibility of subduing it.”\n\n“Duke Long has a good plan indeed! Now that the five regions’ earth veins are becoming one, and Di Zang Sheng’s power comes from the earth vein, once they combine, Di Zang Sheng’s power will rise by at least five times!”\n\n“Don’t forget, when the earth veins become one and the five regional walls vanish, the world would be in chaos and conflict, by then, there will be a great amount of fear, hatred, jealousy, and other emotions. With that, Di Zang Sheng’s strength will rise again.”\n\nEastern Sea’s immortals conversed as some gasped.\n\nAt this rate, among the legendary immemorial desolate beasts, Di Zang Sheng might become the number one among them.\n\nIt already had peak rank eight battle strength to begin with, after the boost, it might even be able to reach pseudo-Immortal Venerable!\n\n“No wonder Duke Long paid a huge price to obtain Dragon Palace, he wanted to subdue a pseudo-Immortal Venerable battle strength to suppress the situation.”\n\n“Thankfully we came to stop Heavenly Court’s plan, otherwise, we will have trouble during the five regions chaotic war.”\n\n_2_Eastern Sea’s immortals were very glad.\n\n“No wonder we could only hear dragon roars even though the formation broke, Di Zang Sheng has not escaped yet.”\n\n“Right now, Dragon Palace is suppressing Di Zang Sheng, we need to wait a bit more.”\n\n“That’s right, after Dragon Palace subdues Di Zang Sheng, not only would we gain a rank eight Immortal Gu House, we will also gain an existence with great battle strength.”\n\n_1_“If Heavenly Court finds out, they would probably puke blood.”\n\n“Hahaha, truly fantastic, fantastic.”\n\nEmperor City battlefield.\n\nImmortal killer move — Great Thief Ghost Hand!\n\nFang Yuan activated it in succession, Heavenly Court’s Immortal Gu Houses avoided them wherever the ghost hands went.\n\nGreat thief ghost hand could steal Gu worms, Fang Yuan could use this killer move to steal rank eight Immortal Gu, even if they were hiding inside the grotto-heavens of Gu Immortals.\n\nThe essence of Immortal Gu Houses was the combination of Gu worms to create a stable form. It could be seen as a combination of many killer moves, or a mobile immortal formation.\n\nBe it immortal killer move, Immortal Gu House, or immortal formation, they were all ways to use Gu worms. Even though they appear different, the essence was the same.\n\nGreat thief ghost hand could even steal Gu worms inside immortal apertures, not to mention Immortal Gu Houses which were essentially mobile immortal formations that exposed their Gu worms on the outside.\n\nUndeniably, great thief ghost hand countered Immortal Gu Houses!\n\nFang Yuan relied on great thief ghost hand to attack, managing to steal many Gu worms.\n\nHe had targeted Immortal Gu Houses before, but that was Great Space Temple which had a method that resisted great thief ghost hand. In truth, most Immortal Gu Houses did not have a way to counter Fang Yuan’s great thief ghost hand.\n\nThe Immortal Gu House defense line that Heavenly Court meticulously created became a huge mess because of Fang Yuan’s interference and influence.\n\n“Scoundrel Fang Yuan, accept your death!” At the critical moment, Li Huang shouted as he pounced at Fang Yuan with verdant sun flame cloak on him.\n\nHeavenly Court’s Immortal Gu Houses could not deal with Fang Yuan, but their Gu Immortals could.\n\nIt was much harder for great thief ghost hand to steal Immortal Gu from immortal apertures than Immortal Gu Houses!\n\nEspecially when Li Huang had verdant sun flame cloak, it could defend against Fang Yuan’s great thief ghost hand.\n\nFang Yuan saw that Li Huang had approached him, he advanced instead of retreating: “Li Huang, you finally showed up at long last, I’ve been waiting for you!”\n\nAt the next moment, Fang Yuan turned into the immemorial year monkey and spitted.\n\nInstantly, spring scissors killer move flew out, tearing through space as it targeted Li Huang.\n\nNext, Fang Yuan breathed in deeply as the monkey grabbed empty space with both hands, pulling out a huge fan out of nowhere.\n\nIt was immortal killer move — Summer Fan.\n\nSnip!\n\n“What?!” Li Huang had a shocked gaze as the cloak on his back became torn, its defense was greatly lowered.\n\nFan!\n\nWhoosh!\n\nIntense winds blew, the world changed colors.\n\nLi Huang was hit as he flew far away due to the wind.\n\n“How did his strength rise so drastically?” Li Huang looked at the tiny spark left on his verdant sun flame cloak as he showed an ugly expression.\n\nBecause when he got attacked earlier, he saw that the situation was bad and activated verdant sun flame cloak once again.\n\nThis fire path defensive killer move had a great attribute, it could be used consecutively and stacked. The weakness was that the expended immortal essence would be twice as high!"
