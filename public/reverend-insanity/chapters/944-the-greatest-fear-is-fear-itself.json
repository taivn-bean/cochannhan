Peopleir must die eventually, Huang Er, stop crying, let mother tell you a story.”\n\nThis was a story in <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>.\n\nLegend says that Ren Zu tried to rely on the capabilities of the feathermen to save his daughter, who was still stuck inside ordinary abyss.\n\nHowever, the feathermen wanted freedom, they did not want to be restricted.\n\nRen Zu thought of a scheme, but he failed, the feathermen would rather die than compromise their freedom.\n\nRen Zu fell into deep perplexity.\n\nHe could not find a better way to save his children.\n\nThe same situation applied to his eldest son, Verdant Great Sun, and also his daughter, Boundless Forest Samsara.\n\nAt this time, self Gu spoke in Ren Zu’s heart: “Oh human, you want to save your son, Verdant Great Sun, I have a method.”\n\nRen Zu thought that he had to save at least one of them, he quickly asked: “Oh? What method?”\n\nSelf Gu laughed: “All living beings in this world will die, this is because fate Gu entered the door of life and death, and left a trace behind when searching for fairness Gu. Oh human, you can enter the door of life and death, and walk on the road of life and death, as long as you do not walk on the traces of fate, you will step on a road that belongs to you solely. When you walk into the door of life and death and leave again, you will form a brand new road, that would be partway to success.”\n\n“Next, as long as you bring Verdant Great Sun onto the path that you walked on, and leave the door of life and death, you will be able to return to the human world where the sun shines. Your son, Verdant Great Sun, will be able to escape death and revive.”\n\nRen Zu heard the method of self Gu and was very hesitant, but there was no better solution available.\n\nThus, he decided to let Boundless Forest Samsara stay inside ordinary abyss for a while longer, while he used the method taught by self Gu to save his eldest son, Verdant Great Sun.\n\nRen Zu set off towards the door of life and death, as he walked, one day, he met with a beastman.\n\nThis beastman was very muscular, his muscles were like rocks, the fangs in his mouth were sharper than blades. He took huge steps, sprinting in the wilderness as he shouted: “Don’t get any closer, don’t come here! I am afraid!”\n\nRen Zu was very curious, he asked: “Oh beastman, what are you afraid of?”\n\nThe beastman said: “I am afraid of my own shadow, it keeps following me, I cannot get rid of it. I am so afraid that I can only run around in all directions, I am tired, hungry, and thirsty, I am going to die!”\n\nRen Zu felt that this was funny: “Oh beastman, you have such a powerful body, yet you are afraid of a harmless shadow, do you have a cowardly heart? What is there to be afraid of?”\n\nAt this time, a Gu worm came out of the beastman’s heart, it laughed at Ren Zu: “Oh human, do not speak so shamelessly. You do not feel afraid because you have not encountered me, fear Gu. Hehehehehe.”\n\n“Fear Gu?” Ren Zu took a step back, his expression changed.\n\nOnce fear Gu appeared, fear started to well up in Ren Zu’s heart.\n\nHe was afraid.\n\nFear Gu laughed even more arrogantly now, it said to the beastman: “I will let you off now, little beastman, you pitiful worm.”\n\nThe beastman was free now, it fell to the ground, weeping in extreme joy.\n\nFear Gu turned around, facing Ren Zu: “Oh human, you dared to look down on me, fear Gu, now I will torture you with endless fear!”\n\nSaying this, fear Gu flew into Ren Zu’s heart with a whooshing sound.\n\nRen Zu felt immense fear.\n\nHe was afraid of this, and afraid of that.\n\nFear Gu made him scared of the wind, every time the wind blew, Ren Zu screamed in horror.\n\nFear Gu made him afraid of sunlight, Ren Zu could only travel at night and often lost his way, during daytime he would enter caves or hide inside thick bushes.\n\nFear Gu also made Ren Zu afraid of tree leaves, thus Ren Zu ran away from the forests, every tree he saw made him shriek.\n\nFear Gu made Ren Zu afraid of snakes, in the end, Ren Zu even stopped using the grass ropes that he made himself.\n\nAfter that, fear Gu made Ren Zu scared of rain.\n\nWhenever it rained, Ren Zu would shrivel up and look at the sky that was raining continuously, feeling extreme fear.\n\nRen Zu wanted to go to the door of life and death, but after being struck by fear Gu, he could not move much, he could not make any progress.\n\nWhen fear Gu understood Ren Zu’s motive, it made Ren Zu scared of death.\n\nRen Zu no longer dared to walk towards the door of life and death.\n\nBecause once he entered the door of life and death, he would be walking from life towards death.\n\nRen Zu was afraid that he would die, he could only stay in place.\n\nSelf Gu sighed: “Oh human, actually death is not scary, the real scary thing is the fear in your heart.”\n\n“That is right!” Fear Gu heard this and said proudly: “The only thing worth being afraid of is fear!”\n\nFairy Bai Qing spoke this story as Feng Jin Huang was silent in her arms.\n\nFairy Bai Qing looked at her daughter lovingly, she said again: “Huang Er, no matter what, you have to become stronger, and face death head on! Death is not scary, everybody dies, not even a rank nine venerable is spared from it. Your father might be dead or alive. But one day, I will certainly die, and so will you. Never be defeated by the fear in your heart.”\n\nFeng Jin Huang’s body shuddered.\n\nShe struggled lightly, freeing herself from her mother’s warm hug.\n\nTears were still flickering in her eyes, but she showed determination and fortitude.\n\nShe looked at Fairy Bai Qing, gritting her teeth: “Mother, I understand! I will go cultivate now, there will be no fear in my heart, no matter how father is right now, I will not be fearful, I will face it directly, and face any possible outcome. I am Feng Jin Huang, how can I make father and mother lose face?”\n\n“Hehehe, you are really a good child.” Fairy Bai Qing concealed the worry in her eyes, her face was filled with a smile.\n\nActually, she was frantic internally.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s disappearance hugely influenced matters.\n\nSpirit Affinity House recruited Feng Jiu Ge, allowing them to be at the lead of the ten ancient sects in this generation. The other nine sects faced some suppression in one way or another.\n\nThese were the characteristics of a society where one person could cultivate to have great strength.\n\nThe influence of one person was expanded hugely.\n\nRight now, Feng Jiu Ge was not around, Spirit Affinity House’s authority fell drastically, the other nine sects were ready to make trouble, Central Continent had deep undercurrents that could create huge tremors and drastic changes.\n\nIt was like this outside of the sect.\n\nBut within her own sect, Fairy Bai Qing also was not having an easy time.\n\nPlaces with people will have competition for benefits.\n\nWhere there are sects, there is internal strife.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s disappearance made the ones who were had been suppressed to the lowest level able to suddenly raise their heads.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was too powerful, to the extent that Fairy Bai Qing had almost forgotten that there were many people in the sect who was against them.\n\nThese last days, those people had been gathering strength and ostracizing Fairy Bai Qing.\n\nFairy Bai Qing loved Feng Jiu Ge deeply, she wanted to go to Northern Plains and help him. But she had been controlling herself, holding down this impulse.\n\nShe had a daughter to care for, Feng Jiu Ge was so powerful but he still went missing, she could not move carelessly.\n\nIf even she was gone, what would Feng Jin Huang do?\n\n“She is just a child!” This was Fairy Bai Qing’s thoughts.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of every parent, their children were always children.\n\nNorthern Plains.\n\nHei Cheng’s headless corpse was still in the mud.\n\nHis soul was wailing, but he could not escape from Hei Lou Lan’s hands.\n\nHei Lou Lan killed Hei Cheng and stomped on her father’s head, but it was not enough. Now, Hei Cheng’s soul had also been captured, he was surely going to be tortured and interrogated by Hei Lou Lan.\n\nMeanwhile, Blazing Heaven Demoness squatted on the ground and used an immortal killer move.\n\nA small hand of flames appeared out of nowhere, grabbing at Hei Cheng’s stomach.\n\nThe small fire hand easily fused into Hei Cheng’s corpse, after fiddling around for a while, it flew out while holding onto a pearl.\n\n“This is Hei Cheng’s immortal aperture, I have temporarily retrieved it. Little Lan, take it, it can only last for seven days and seven nights, once the time limit is up, my immortal killer move will stop and the immortal aperture will fuse with the outside world to form a blessed land. It is a pity that the Gu worms in the immortal aperture, be them mortal or immortal, have all been destroyed.”\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness said as she passed the fire pearl into Hei Lou Lan’s hands.\n\nHei Lou Lan received it silently.\n\nFairy Li Shan and Fang Yuan were inwardly shocked by Blazing Heaven Demoness’ method.\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness laughed: “Don’t look at me with such expressions. Hehehe, this method of taking an immortal aperture is not a skill devised originally by me. I obtained an inheritance of Immortal Kong Jue in Eastern Sea, I learned his method of retrieving apertures, and created this fire path immortal killer move.”\n\nBlazing Heaven Demoness was an extremely rare great grandmaster.\n\nAt this attainment level, it was easy to understand capabilities of other paths using their own as a foundation, her methods were very comprehensive in all aspects.\n\n“Alright, now, we will talk about your matter, Fang Yuan.” Fairy Li Shan looked towards Fang Yuan with a coldly smiling expression."
