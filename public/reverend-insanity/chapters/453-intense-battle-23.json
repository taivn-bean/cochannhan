Myriad wolf king also seemed to be staring back at him; when beasts evolves to myriad beast king stage, their intelligence would greatly surpass similar species, and this myriad wolf king was clearly indicating its decision to target Fang Yuan.\n\n“Ge Guang stay behind and cooperate with three elders to kill this wolf! As for the others, follow me.” Fang Yuan turned around and walked; subduing this thousand wolf king was not an impossible matter, but it would be very troublesome and time consuming.\n\nThis wolf was not suitable, so it was better to go to another. Anyway, the battlefield was so large, Fang Yuan did not believe all of them would have methods to suppress wolf enslavement Gu.\n\nSure enough, he moved around to several places and reaped great harvests. In just about two hours, he subdued seventeen hundred wolf kings and two thousand wolf kings.\n\nAdding in all the wolves, Fang Yuan now had four thousand wolf kings, over thirty hundred wolf kings and ordinary wolves were already over eight thousand in number, nearing ten thousand.\n\nMost of them were all turtleback wolves, but there was also a thousand beast level wind wolf king. Among the hundred wolf kings, there were also poison beard wolf king, water wolf king and wind wolf king.\n\nWith his actions, the military strength between the two sides in the battlefield was being equalized. A portion of the thirty thousand ten thousand wolf group was incorporated by Fang Yuan into his troop and adding in countless deaths, the wolf group only had about twenty thousand remaining now.\n\nThe battle surged on like wildfire and Ge tribe leader eased his brows, seeing the hope of victory.\n\n“With Chang Shan Yin making his move, the pressure on my tribe’s troops has greatly decreased.”\n\n“He is after all the legendary hero, his skills are truly exceptional!”\n\n“This is not strange, he is a rank four Gu Master, moreover he walks the enslavement path; such battlefields are his domain.”\n\nAll the elders praised and the atmosphere in the main tent became relaxed.\n\n“Don’t be careless, myriad wolf king still has not made its move, the outcome of this battle is yet to be certain.” Ge tribe leader timely warned others.\n\n“Lord tribe leader is right, we can’t relax yet.”\n\n“In my opinion, this myriad wolf king might not join the fight. The wolf group has suffered huge losses, it is normal for the wolf king to retreat in this situation.”\n\n“Huh? Not good!”\n\nJust as they were talking of it, myriad wolf king suddenly let out a long howl. All the wolves in the battlefield simultaneously went into crazed offense when they heard this howl.\n\nOver twenty thousand turtleback wolves charged towards the camp without caring for their lives; for a moment, Ge tribe was caught off-guard and was utterly losing.\n\n“Order the frontline to quickly retreat to the second defensive line.” Ge tribe leader immediately commanded.\n\n“The wolf group is making an all-out attack!” Ge Guang who was on the frontline paled.\n\n“Go help the Gu Masters to retreat, I will go back to the ranch to rest and organize, wait for my support.” Fang Yuan’s expression was dark.\n\n“Lord, we have been ordered by the tribe leader to protect you.” Some Gu Masters hesitated.\n\nFang Yuan opened his eyes and let out a sharp gaze; the Gu Masters where his gaze landed all lowered their head.\n\n“Ge Guang.” Fang Yuan looked at the young tribe leader of Ge tribe.\n\nGe Guang gritted his teeth: “I shall listen to uncle.”\n\nHe then waved his hand: “All of you follow me!”\n\nFang Yuan returned to the ranch alone, surrounded by wolves.\n\nHe gathered all the wolves together. With close to ten thousand wolves crowding together, this temporary ranch immediately felt narrow.\n\nFang Yuan willed and a strong vigorous water wolf moved out of the wolf group.\n\nTo ordinary people, this was a water wolf. But in Fang Yuan’s eyes, it was a white-eyes wolf.\n\nWhite-eyes wolf was a mutated beast, like Biao among tigers and lightning boar among boars. Every single ordinary adult mutated beasts would attract wild Gu worms and possessed the strength that could match myriad beast kings.\n\nHowever, this white-eyes wolf was still in infancy and had not matured yet. The fur on its whole body was like water and was dyed with a light blue color; the appearance of a common water wolf. But as long as people carefully observed it, they would discover its pupils was more white with little black, greatly differing from ordinary water wolves.\n\nWhen it completely reached adulthood, its pupils would become white. At the same time, its vision would be greatly magnified, comparable to some rank four investigative Gu and even at night, its vision would not be affected.\n\nFang Yuan had accidentally discovered this white-eyes wolf in the market, and without making any suspicious movements, he bought all the water wolves.\n\nAt present, this white-eyes wolf had already been planted with rank three wolf enslavement Gu by Fang Yuan. And to speed up its growth, he had used third watch Gu.\n\nThis created a violent increase in the white-eyes wolf’s appetite, about thirteen times more than the ordinary water wolves. Also, its lifespan had shortened.\n\n“Go.” Fang Yuan gave a command and this white-eyes wolf whose speed already surpassed that of the wind wolves, quickly moved out of the ranch towards the higher grounds.\n\nWolf care Gu!\n\nFang Yuan covered his right eye and only used his left eye to look at the white-eyes wolf. At the same time, he poured his primeval essence into Chang Shan Yin’s investigative Gu.\n\nInstantly, the scene in his left eye changed; as if he was overlooking the battlefield from a high ground.\n\nThis was the ability of the wolf care Gu; it could share the sight of the specific wolf to the Gu Master’s eyes.\n\nFang Yuan then opened his right eye, and two different scenes transmitted to his brain at the same time.\n\nHis left eye showed the battlefield, letting him be clear on the situation; and his right eye showed the ranch where the wolves were crowded together.\n\nFang Yuan summoned all the wolf kings and searched through the Gu worms in their body.\n\nIf there were any rare Gu worms, Fang Yuan would take them so as to not let them be destroyed in the battlefield.\n\nNaturally, his main focus was the wolf enslavement Gu.\n\nWolf enslavement Gu was a one time expendable Gu.\n\nTo capture so many wolf kings, Fang Yuan had used up a lot of wolf enslavement Gu.\n\nGenerally speaking, wolf kings would have corresponding wolf enslavement Gu on them.\n\nSure enough, Fang Yuan got a rank three wolf enslavement Gu and five rank two wolf enslavement Gu from these wolf kings.\n\nAs for other Gu worms, they were all ordinary with only one or two being better. But they could not catch Fang Yuan’s eyes, so he left them on the wolf kings to preserve their battle strength.\n\nWolf smoke Gu!\n\nFang Yuan activated this rank four healing Gu which was especially used to heal the injuries on wolves. Surging smoke enveloped the whole ranch for a long time.\n\nFang Yuan’s primeval sea rapidly lowered to the bottom.\n\nThe primeval essence consumption to heal so many wolves at once was very huge.\n\nWhen the primeval sea hit the bottom, Fang Yuan took out primeval stones and quickly recovered his primeval essence.\n\nAfter healing them twice more, Fang Yuan saw Ge tribe leader lead a group of elders and rush towards the frontlines. Soon, intense explosions sounded out from the frontlines.\n\nThrough his left eye, Fang Yuan saw that the motionless myriad wolf king had also joined the fight. Ge tribe leader and others all went all-out against it.\n\nWith myriad wolf king joining the fight, there was a tremendous influence on the wolves and under its lead, the wolf group began to fight with even more madness.\n\nThe second defensive line of Ge tribe was also thus broken.\n\nFortunately, with the canal blocking the way, most of Ge tribe’s Gu Masters could smoothly retreat towards the third defensive line and maintain the defense. For a moment, the atmosphere on the battlefield intensified to the extreme, causing great palpitation in the people.\n\nThe third defensive line was the final defense. Behind it was the weakest mortals, in case it was broken through, the consequences would be unimaginable.\n\n“There is no time to heal again.” After recovering the primeval essence in his aperture to ninety percent, Fang Yuan looked at the surroundings.\n\nAfter three rounds of healing, the heavy injuries on these wolves had become light injuries while the light injuries were completely healed.\n\nWolf howl Gu!\n\nFang Yuan howled towards the sky, letting out a furious howl like that of a wolf king.\n\nUnder the effect of the Gu worm, the wolf group on the ranch faintly enlarged, their energy inflated and their battle strength multiplied!\n\nFang Yuan laughed loudly and rode on a hump wolf, with a shift of his mind, the wolf group immediately started howling together.\n\nHowl—!\n\nAt this moment, when the sky was dyed red with the setting sun, when the wind was starting to blow strongly and when the battle was raging, the wolf howl spread without restrain, travelling a thousand li.\n\n“Eh? Chang Shan Yin is making his move!” Outside the battlefield, Man Hong and Man Hao’s expression turned grave.\n\nGe tribe, however, was jubilant.\n\n“Chang Shan Yin, it is lord Chang Shan Yin!”\n\n“We still have lord Chang Shan Yin…”\n\n“Lord Chang Shan Yin is coming to support us, everyone persevere!!”\n\n“Step aside, open up a path for lord Chang Shan Yin.”\n\nInstantly, Ge tribe’s troop morale rose rapidly.\n\nFang Yuan sat upright on the hump wolf and lightly waved his hand; close to ten thousand wolves surged forward, moving past the simplistic fence around the ranch, but they did not go to rescue the northern side, but instead moved towards the south.\n\nJust like the collapse of a large dam, a powerful flood burst out! The whole wolf group rapidly charged out of the camp; twelve hundred wolf kings arranged as the arrowhead ruthlessly charged into the battlefield\n\nThe enemy wolf group had fought for a long time and was already exhausted, and now this new battle force attacked them, causing countless deaths in moments.\n\nWith only one assault, Fang Yuan collapsed the offense of the turtleback wolves on the southern side of the camp.\n\nWolf enslavement Gu! Wolf enslavement Gu! Wolf enslavement Gu!\n\nUnder the protection of the wolf group, Fang Yuan repeatedly activated three wolf enslavement Gu; the enslavement Gu changed into faint smoke and subdued three hundred wolf kings in moments.\n\n“Charge to the left!” He willed it and the whole wolf army smoothly changed direction and charged towards the southeast battle.\n\nFang Yuan’s gaze scanned the battle like an eagle and soon locked onto the thousand wolf king.\n\nThousand wolf king howled and did its utmost to command the wolf group. But most of the wolf group were in deeply locked in the battle in the frontline and would be difficult for them to turn around for a while.\n\nThis thousand wolf king could only mobilize a few hundred wolves which were easily drowned by Fang Yuan’s army.\n\nRank three wolf enslavement Gu!\n\nFang Yuan caught the chance and a faint smoke drilled down into the thousand wolf king; this thousand wolf king might have been scared stiff as it let out a whimper, its soul did not give any resistance and was quickly subdued.\n\nThis was the fifth thousand wolf king!\n\nThe wolf group that had been fighting with the Gu Masters, under its beckoning, stopped the fight and gathered under Fang Yuan’s army.\n\nThe chaos at the southeast area immediately ceased!"
