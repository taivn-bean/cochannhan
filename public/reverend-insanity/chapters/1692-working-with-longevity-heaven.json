These days, in this battle, it displayed very powerful offensive and defensive methods, if I can get it, I will obtain peak rank eight battle strength!”\n\nFang Yuan’s main body chased while heaven form killer move stayed in immemorial white heaven, dealing with Beast Calamity Grotto-heaven and finding the hiding spot of adaptation Immortal Gu.\n\nHeaven form killer move was rank nine and extremely mobile, even within immemorial white heaven, there were few existences which could threaten it.\n\nBecause of the earth vein’s turbulence, the Gu Immortals of the five regions were in chaos.\n\nEspecially, Eastern Sea, the emergence of Dragon Palace caused a battle among rank eights, it was truly spectacular.\n\nOn this day, Northern Plains’ Longevity Heaven also started to tremor intensely.\n\nBzzz bzzz bzzz….\n\nOrange-yellow light flickered endlessly, enveloping the sky of Longevity Heaven.\n\nNext, an aura started from an extremely weak state and grew rapidly, soon filling the world and causing fear in everyone.\n\nSuch a change had already attracted the attention of Five Elements Grandmaster, Bull Demon, and Flower Lady.\n\nFive Elements Grandmaster was a lone cultivator of Northern Plains, but after getting trapped by Longevity Heaven, he felt despair after struggling and decided to join Longevity Heaven, he was not stationed in Longevity Heaven permanently.\n\nBull Demon and Flower Lady were a duo that took the role of North Desolation Immortal together.\n\nBull Demon was a muscular brute with a thick beard and a thunderous voice, he was extremely tall and strong, having a powerful aura. Flower Lady was a little girl with a flower on her head, she sat on the muscular man’s shoulder, giggling as her crystal-like eyes flickered with innocence.\n\n“What happened?” Five Elements Grandmaster was very uncertain.\n\nBull Demon and Flower Lady looked at each other, the latter giggled: “West Desolation Immortal Bing Sai Chuan has awakened!”\n\nLongevity Heaven was a bit different from Heavenly Court, it had Four Desolation Immortals and Eight Extremities, a total of twelve positions. Among which, the Four Desolation Immortals were only meant for rank eight Gu Immortals, while the Eight Extremities needed at least rank seven cultivation level, and they had to be elites among rank sevens.\n\n“Bing Sai Chuan?” Five Elements Grandmaster’s brows rose, he felt that the name was familiar but he could not get more information from just that name.\n\nAt this moment, there was a loud roar, ripples of light flickered in the sky, rainbows extended like rivers as they pierced through the horizons.\n\nA figure walked down from the river, he had a tall body and delicate face, nevertheless, his eyes were extremely sharp and icy, emitting a cold gaze. From his right ear to the left corner of his lips, there was an ugly scar, it was flickering with white light, while emitting the coldness of a thousand year profound ice.\n\nSeeing this face, Five Elements Grandmaster’s eyes burst out with bright light as he became deeply shocked: “I remember now, this is the Bing Sai Chuan who was born in Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s generation, he was a rank eight legend, a time path great expert, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable had tried three times before subduing him. He did not die, he is actually the West Desolation Immortal of Longevity Heaven?!”\n\nWest Desolation Immortal was born in the same generation as Giant Sun Immortal Venerable, even though he lost, it was not a disgrace. After all, be they Immortal Venerable or Demon Venerable, they were invincible in the world with no equal.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable had to make three attempts to subdue this West Desolation Immortal, it showed that he had great strength!\n\n“Greetings, Senior West Desolation.” Bull Demon and Flower Lady quickly went to greet him while Five Elements Grandmaster followed after with an expression of reverence.\n\nWest Desolation Immortal Bing Sai Chuan’s seniority was simply too high.\n\nBing Sai Chuan went up to the three, he nodded after looking around: “I am awake but I do not have much lifespan, time is limited. Give me the information of the current world, I need to know about it.”\n\nLongevity Heaven had very comprehensive information.\n\nThey had detailed information of the collapse of Eighty-Eight True Yang Building, the reappearance of Dragon Palace in Eastern Sea, and the Refinement Path Convention of Central Continent’s Heavenly Court.\n\n“Eighty-Eight True Yang Building truly collapsed…” Bing Sai Chuan sighed deeply.\n\n“It was Fang Yuan, that demon was reborn using Spring Autumn Cicada, he is rank eight already.” Five Elements Grandmaster gritted his teeth.\n\nBing Sai Chuan laughed loudly as he said: “Good job, Fang Yuan, he is truly a demon, he did a great job in destroying Eighty-Eight True Yang Building!”\n\nFive Elements Grandmaster was stunned: “What?”\n\nBull Demon looked at Flower Lady: “…”\n\nFlower Lady looked at Bull Demon: “…”\n\nThe three immortals were completely shocked.\n\nNext, Bing Sai Chuan added: “Fate Gu is about to be repaired, it seems that this Refinement Path Convention is the final one. There is no time, we have to contact Fang Yuan now and make an alliance!”\n\nThe gazes of Five Elements Grandmaster, Bull Demon, and Flower Lady changed abruptly.\n\nWas this Bing Sai Chuan really the West Desolation Immortal? Could he possibly be a fake one?\n\n“Longevity Heaven wants to cooperate with me?” Fang Yuan received this message and became quite shocked.\n\nIt was easy to contact him, Lang Ya land spirit could do it.\n\nBing Sai Chuan used Lang Ya land spirit to contact Fang Yuan, he spoke openly: “I am West Desolation Immortal, the current leader of Longevity Heaven. Fang Yuan, you are an otherworldly demon but you have yet to obtain Red Lotus’ true inheritance? If Heavenly Court repairs fate Immortal Gu, it will not benefit you at all. Similarly, Longevity Heaven does not want to see Heavenly Court succeed. If they repair fate Gu, it would be too helpful to Heavenly Court, it would also go against the luck path of my Ancestor Giant Sun. Let us forget our past conflicts and resist the strong enemy together!”\n\nFang Yuan was quiet for a while before asking: “You are?”\n\nBing Sai Chuan!\n\nSoon, Fang Yuan learned who the other party was.\n\nHe should be the real deal.\n\nFang Yuan sighed at Longevity Heaven’s foundation, they even concealed a rank eight legend like Bing Sai Chuan, he had only appeared now.\n\nAnd in Longevity Heaven, among the Four Desolation Immortals, East Desolation Immortal had the highest status, the great Bing Sai Chuan was only second place?\n\nWho in the world was the East Desolation Immortal?\n\nLongevity Heaven’s change of attitude made Fang Yuan deeply surprised. But to think of it, against the terrifying Heavenly Court, it was possible for Fang Yuan to work with them.\n\nAfter all, he was a rank eight Gu Immortal now, the leader of Shadow Sect who possessed deep dream path research results, his name shook the world!\n\nA while ago, Heavenly Court even infiltrated Northern Plains and attacked Lang Ya blessed land, the two sides had immense conflicts.\n\nThe saying goes, the enemy of an enemy is my friend!\n\nIf they could cooperate, Fang Yuan naturally wanted to work with Longevity Heaven.\n\nAfter all, Heavenly Court was the true enemy.\n\nBut how could they trust each other?\n\nTo gain Fang Yuan’s trust, Longevity Heaven opened its treasury and traded immortal materials with Fang Yuan, they could even exchange Immortal Gu.\n\nFrom this step, they seemed to be very sincere.\n\n“Since we are cooperating, Lord Bing Sai Chuan, why don’t we work together to fight for Dragon Palace?” Fang Yuan had a thought as he initiated.\n\n“Good idea!” Bing Sai Chuan was in full agreement, any person with a brain could tell that Dragon Palace had immense value."
