I am now worried about Myriad Tidal Dragon’s end. He is controlling two Immortal Gu Houses and also has the help of most of the Gu Immortals that came in this expedition, but what he is facing is Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace as well as Longevity Heaven! We must rescue Ma Hong Yun and Zhao Lian Yun quickly, and join up with Myriad Tidal Dragon, then retreat to Central Continent!”\n\nWei Ling Yang’s gaze flickered continuously.\n\nCentral Continent’s Gu Immortals naturally had come prepared, although they met with an accident in the spaceless tunnel, Central Continent’s accumulation was more than enough, when these Gu Immortals reacted, they quickly and smoothly escaped the danger.\n\nBut the current situation was extremely unfavorable to them!\n\nIt was already difficult to deal with Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace. Now that they had split their forces, the decision maker, Wei Ling Yang, was facing great mental pressure.\n\nRumble!\n\nThunderous explosions occurred endlessly, Edge Link Camp was shaking continuously and was losing ground.\n\nCentral Continent’s two rank eight Gu Immortals were elites among rank eights and were qualified to be members of Heavenly Court, they were naturally very powerful.\n\nHowever, Northern Plains excelled in battle strength among the five regions, and Old Ancestor Xue Hu was the strongest expert among the rank eights of the current Northern Plains.\n\nRight now, he displayed such astonishing offense that Central Continent’s side was not able to gain the upper hand since the moment they had started fighting him!\n\n“This won’t do! Treat your injuries and control the Immortal Gu House. I will go distract Old Ancestor Xue Hu!” Bi Chen Tian said through clenched teeth.\n\n“You must be careful.” Wei Ling Yang said to Bi Chen Tian with concern in his voice, as he knew his injuries had yet to recover.\n\nBi Chen Tian flew out of Edge Link Camp and quickly used his immortal killer move, turning into a green ray of light, and flying down towards the snowy peaks.\n\nBi Chen Tian intended to destroy the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation.\n\nWith its destruction, Edge Link Camp would not be obstructed and could dive down without resistance, directly saving Zhao Lian Yun and perhaps Ma Hong Yun as well.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu might be powerful, but he would not be able to block Edge Link Camp’s charge.\n\n“Stop daydreaming.” Old Ancestor Xue Hu had already seen through Central Continent’s tactics, he activated his immortal killer move, immediately, endless hailstones fell down from the sky.\n\nEach of these hailstones was enormous, the size of a mound. They crashed down with loud sounds, and started turning into snow monsters.\n\nThese snow monsters were of at least desolate beast level and among them were ancient desolate beast snow monsters as well.\n\nThey stood on the snowy peaks and roared towards the sky.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu suddenly took in a deep breath, two lumps of cold air, so deeply blue that they were to the point of being black, were forming in his breath.\n\nThe cold air was emitted, giving rise to a powerful blizzard. The snow monsters were like fish in water in the blizzard, they were even able to soar with the help of the blizzard. Bi Chen Tian, however, was greatly restricted.\n\n“So powerful!”\n\n“Old Ancestor Xue Hu knows he cannot use battlefield killer moves inside the Gu formation, so he actually disassembled his signature battlefield killer move. His ice and snow path attainment is probably already at great grandmaster level!”\n\nWhether it be Bi Chen Tian or Wei Ling Yang, they were both shocked at this scene.\n\nAt great grandmaster level, every killer move could be casually disassembled and interchanged at will, their understanding towards the path was already close to the Dao.\n\n“But, what if you add me?” Wei Ling Yang sneered, the next moment, he also charged out of Edge Link Camp, towards the Gu formation.\n\nThe injury on his right had already healed completely.\n\nHe clearly had very high attainment in the healing aspect.\n\nOld Ancestor Xue Hu’s expression slightly changed.\n\nFacing two rank eight Gu Immortals at once, along with an Immortal Gu House, he clearly appeared to be stretched thin and had slightly lost his control over the battle situation.\n\nAfter all, he was unable to destroy the Immortal Gu House for the moment, and the two rank eight Gu Immortals were also experts, most importantly, Old Ancestor Xue Hu had to protect the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation.\n\nRank six and rank seven Gu Immortals could not break this formation, but rank eight Gu Immortals were different.\n\nBi Chen Tian and Wei Ling Yang were attacking the enemy’s weak points, gradually turning around their situation and gaining slight initiative. Immortal Gu House Edge Link Camp was controlled by a group of rank seven Gu Immortals and was like a turtle shell in defense, not seeking glory on the battlefield but content with not showing flaws, not allowing Old Ancestor Xue Hu to make a fatal move for some time.\n\nBoom boom boom.\n\nEvery now and then, the fate reversing sacrificial refinement formation shook and emitted buzzing sounds.\n\nThis was the result of a small portion of attacks from Bi Chen Tian or Wei Ling Yang that had escaped Old Ancestor Xue Hu’s obstruction, striking Snowy Mountain blessed land.\n\n“Amazing!”\n\n“Hang in there, lords and our comrades of Central Continent!”\n\nZhao Lian Yun and the group no longer needed to take a risk, they were standing at the top of their respective snowy peaks, and gazing at the battle above.\n\nSimilarly, the surviving snowy peak lords were also gazing at the sky.\n\nTheir faces were filled with worry.\n\n“The is the power of rank eight Gu Immortals… It is truly astonishing and terrifying!”\n\n“Because of this formation, the aftereffects of the battle have not spread, otherwise we would have died miserably.”\n\n“Lord Xue Hu is strong, but the Central Continent invaders are extremely crafty. If this goes on, the formation will be destroyed sooner or later…”\n\nAnd, on the first snowy peak of Snowy Mountain, the refinement of the purple gold rock immortal material had reached its final stage.\n\n“I didn’t expect that I had to use enshrouding fragrance to dissolve the purple gold rock.” Lady Wan Shou’s horizons had broadened at this moment.\n\nEnshrouding fragrance was also an immortal material.\n\nUsing immortal material to refine immortal material, this method was rarely seen, and Lady Wan Shou also found that the essence of this method was food path!\n\nFood path was rare, no wonder Lady Wan Shou had no ideas on how to deal with this purple gold rock.\n\nThe last layer of the rock surface was dissolved, and a dazzling purple light soared to the skies, forcing everyone to look away.\n\nLady Wan Shou narrowed her eyes to a slit, and was barely able to see a figure in the purple light.\n\nThis figure was very small, only about the size of an adult’s thumb, and it had two thin purple wings on its back.\n\n“Miniman?” Lady Wan Shou was slightly stunned as she recognized this figure’s race.\n\nBathed in the purple light, the miniman slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were a bright and deep purple color.\n\nAs he opened his eyes, a powerful aura leaked out of him.\n\nRank eight Gu Immortal!\n\nIn an instant, this aura caused the fierce battle in the air to slow down.\n\n“Why is there another rank eight Gu Immortal? And it… is the aura of Northern Plains!” Bi Chen Tian and Wei Ling Yang looked at each other, both feeling the situation going awry.\n\n“We pay respects to Lord Purple!” Ying Wu Xie had already brought the Gu Immortals with him, to bow towards this rank eight miniman.\n\nOnly Bai Ning Bing was still standing upright.\n\n“I have woken up again. Hmm…” The miniman Gu Immortal blinked his eyes, the expression of confusion quickly disappeared from his face, replaced by a cold and indifferent expression."
