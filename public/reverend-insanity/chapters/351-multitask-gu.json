As for the steel armor dog groups, it was a sea of black.\n\nFang Yuan mobilized the big lightning symbol dog to the front, waving his hand and sending the dogs out to attack as the vanguard.\n\nBig steel armor dog barked, upon seeing the big lightning symbol dog appear, it stepped into the battlefield as well.\n\nBeside it, the steel armor dog group followed closely behind, they were like a huge black cloud, flying down from the mound, giving off a terrifying aura.\n\nThe dog groups clashed together, Fang Yuan had a limited number of vanguards, quickly engulfed by the huge number of steel armor dogs.\n\nBut because of the big lightning symbol dog’s existence, the steel armor dog group could not take them down so easily.\n\nThe big lightning symbol dog was after all a hundred beast king, under the attack of the dog group, it was able to handle them left and right, putting up a brave fight. Ordinary steel armor dogs were not its match.\n\nWoof!\n\nThe big steel armor dog stepped out, finally stopping the assault of the big lightning symbol dog.\n\nOnly a hundred beast king could stop a hundred beast king.\n\nAs the intense battle continued, big lightning symbol dog started to weaken. It had just undergone a battle earlier, and there was still injuries on it, causing its battle strength to be lower than usual. Furthermore, its specialty was speed, but it was going head to head with the big steel armor dog who specialized in defense, it obviously had the disadvantage.\n\nFang Yuan saw this, and sent his dog group over.\n\nThe new troops flowed in like a river, entering the battle causing chaos.\n\nBut the enemy was the steel armor dogs, experts at defense, most adept at such battles.\n\nAlthough Fang Yuan sent out his army, and only left a few dog guards behind to protect himself, he could not change the situation.\n\nBe it the hundred beast king battle, or the dog group battle, he was at a disadvantage.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was not worried.\n\nThe truth is, this was what he wanted all along.\n\nHe was waiting.\n\nWaiting for the weapon which suppressed the steel armor dogs to appear.\n\nWoof!\n\nBig lightning symbol dog could not block the attack of the big steel armor dog, and suddenly barked, shooting out a mouthful of blue plasma.\n\nRank two plasma Gu!\n\n“This is it.” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone brightly, as his lips curled up.\n\nSteel armor dog group gathered at their dog king, attacking the big lightning symbol dog while enduring the attacks of Fang Yuan’s dog group, causing them to be closely packed together, like the shape of a black bucket.\n\nBlue plasma landed on the ground, splattering.\n\nLarge amounts of plasma landed on the steel armor dogs, causing their bodies to vibrate as they cried. Not only did their battle strength fall, the formation of the entire dog group was broken and heavily obstructed.\n\nThe armor on the steel armor dogs were of metallic element. Although the steel gave them superior defenses, it also made them unable to resist the power of electricity.\n\nThe attack power of plasma Gu was not high, but once used on the steel armor dogs, it was a formidable move.\n\nThe big lightning symbol dog shot out plasma continuously, as plasma covered the entire battlefield, heavily weakening the battle strength of the steel armor dogs.\n\nThe firm steel-like formation, had collapsed under the effects of plasma Gu.\n\nFang Yuan saw an opportunity, and commanded the dogs to charge, the dog group outside worked together with the big lightning symbol dog in the middle, unleashing a high offensive power.\n\nIf one watched from the sky, they would see that the large black area was first eroded by blue color, before being devoured by the surrounding blend of colors.\n\nBlack continued to reduce, while blue, yellow, and grey overtook them and dominated the field.\n\nThe situation changed quickly, soon, Fang Yuan regained his control, killing most of the steel armor dogs and encircling the big steel armor dog in the middle.\n\nFeeling danger, the Gu worm on the big steel armor dog started to work.\n\nBig steel armor dog gained more strength, while black spikes grew out of its body.\n\nFifteen minutes later, the big steel armor dog’s throat was torn by the big lightning symbol dog, and fell indignantly. Its blood flowed on the ground, but it did not get up anymore.\n\nThe battle ended.\n\nAs for the two Gu worms on the big steel armor dog, one was destroyed during the battle,while the other flew away.\n\nFang Yuan’s expression was grim, in order to kill this hundred beast king, he paid a huge price. He only had half of his dog group left, and it would be a problem for his remaining battles.\n\nAfter twenty rounds, beast kings would appear.\n\nWith the beast king, the dog groups would display greater battle strength, at the same time, the beast king itself was a huge threat.\n\nThe more Gu worms on its body, the stronger it is, and the worse the situation would be for the Gu Master fighting it.\n\nFang Yuan’s luck was bad this time, the big steel armor dog he encountered this time had two Gu. Especially when one of the Gu was good at attack and defense, causing Fang Yuan to suffer great losses.\n\nOne’s own luck matters when challenging the three kings inheritance.\n\nThe steel armor dog group was Fang Yuan’s best choice this time, but his luck was not as good.\n\nA rank two dog enslavement Gu fell from above, as his prize for winning.\n\nFang Yuan did not use the Spring Autumn Cicada, he instantly refined the Gu with the help of the heavenly power.\n\n“This Gu is the key to getting past the next round.” With such a resolution, Fang Yuan stepped into the fog.\n\nLeft, center, right, there were light shadows at all three directions. They were: A large numbers of corpse dogs, a certain number of Yin dogs, and a huge number of hyenas!\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes glowed as he analyzed.\n\nThis time, his strength was limited, thus he had to choose wisely, fighting a weak enemy while thinking of the reward of winning.\n\n“If I defeat the corpse dog group, I get a white silver relic Gu. Killing the Yin dogs give me a two tasks at once Gu…”\n\nWhite silver relic Gu was no use to Fang Yuan. At this stage, only yellow gold relic Gu had an attraction to him.\n\nBut unfortunately, yellow gold relic Gu was heavily controlled even in Shang clan city.\n\nRank four Gu Masters were experts in the mortal Gu Master realm. One yellow gold relic Gu could affect the battle strength among rank four Gu Masters greatly.\n\nIn the market, white silver relic Gu was sold normally, while yellow gold relic Gu were extremely rare, often held in the hands of the higher-ups.\n\nFang Yuan knew, super clans like Shang clan had lots of yellow gold relic Gu in their inventory. But even with the purple thorn token, he could not get them.\n\nShang Yan Fei held these yellow gold relic Gu in his hand, refusing to let them enter the market.\n\nThis was a secret temptation.\n\nIf Fang Yuan truly joined Shang clan, the yellow gold relic Gu would be a form of reward.\n\nShang Yan Fei’s brilliance was not something a commoner could understand. Fang Yuan did not want to compete with him in wits and strength just for a yellow gold relic Gu, and cause his own plans to be stalled.\n\n“In the three kings inheritance, there are yellow gold relic Gu. But only after the fortieth round, if I can get one, the situation would improve greatly.\n\nFang Yuan had desire towards the yellow gold relic Gu.\n\nBut he knew, whether he could get one was all attributed to his own luck.\n\nHe could not force this.\n\nAs for the two tasks at once Gu, it could allow the Gu Master to split his mind into two and was extremely effective in manipulating worm or beast armies.\n\nFang Yuan himself could do four tasks at once, if he added in this Gu, he would be able to do six tasks at once.\n\n“Two tasks at once Gu is only a rank two Gu. Going higher, there are three tasks at once, four tasks at once, five tasks at once and so on. Multitask Gu is the most important tool for an enslavement path Gu Master. Hmm, wait… this is?”\n\nFang Yuan looked at the right, after the hyenas disappeared, it showed a token.\n\nAn ordinary reward is an enslavement path Gu.\n\nBut this reward was slightly special, it was an ordinary looking token.\n\nThe token was rough and had an irregular shape, like it was casually molded into shape by someone. On the surface, there was the carving of San Cha mountain, but this map was extremely casual and ugly, giving a strong feeling of half-heartedness. With one glance, one can easily tell that the person who made this token did not put in any effort, only doing it out of necessity.\n\nBut once Fang Yuan saw this token, his eyes lit up.\n\n“King Quan travel token!” He immediately forgot about the white silver relic Gu, two tasks at once Gu.\n\n“What luck to have encountered this token, I must get it!” Fang Yuan had a determined mind, he had to get this token at all costs.\n\nAlthough this token looked worthless, it was one of the best items.\n\nRight now, no one knew its worth yet, but Fang Yuan knew clearly, towards to end of the three kings inheritance in his previous life, the price of such a token was as high as a rank four Gu!\n\n“But this hyena pack is huge, and there are two dog kings. If I choose this path, the risks are huge. The best scenario is that I enslave one of the two big hyenas during battle. But even so, if I win this battle, I would suffer huge losses and would lose the ability to advance further.”\n\nFang Yuan had a clear understanding of his own strength.\n\nThe advantage of experience was shown here, it allowed him to clearly know the advantages and disadvantages of every choice.\n\nFang Yuan thought about it, and decided to take a risk.\n\nSince he walked on the demonic path, he had to take risks, by taking the extreme path, he would gain the biggest profits. Having no regrets after every choice, this was truly being alive!\n\nFour hours later.\n\nAn intense battle ended.\n\nOn and below the mound, there were dog corpses everywhere. Fresh blood flowed as limbs decorated the ground.\n\nFang Yuan stood on the mound, slightly injured. In this Gu Immortal blessed land, he could not use his Gu, causing him to be extremely weakened.\n\n“But I won anyway…” Fang Yuan looked at his surroundings, only a dozen or so dogs were left, as he sighed deeply.\n\nLosing almost all the dogs that he had, there was no longer any hope of advancing in this cruel demonic inheritance.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had the last bit of hope in his mind.\n\nThe heavenly power descended, sending him into the fog once again.\n\n“If I encounter Bai Ning Bing, by borrowing her strength, I would be able to continue.” But Fang Yuan was to be disappointed.\n\nAll three directions led to dog groups. If he did not have the travel token, Fang Yuan would definitely die.\n\nHe took out the travel token.\n\nGrasping it tightly, he bit the tip of his tongue and spit out some blood.\n\nThe blood landed on the token, and Fang Yuan opened his mouth, saying to the token softy: “Woof.”\n\nThe token emitted a strong light, as it tore through space, dragging Fang Yuan with it.\n\nIn the silent fog, there was no one left."
