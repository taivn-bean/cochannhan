He hid it so well that he definitely had other motives.\n\nAnd looking at the reaction of most of the Lin clan Gu Immortals, they were also unaware of this.\n\nWestern Desert’s righteous path super forces were adopting a wait and see attitude.\n\nMany of them anticipated Lin Jian Xing to give an explanation but Lin clan remained silent and gave no such thing.\n\nThere was no movement in Western Desert’s righteous path.\n\nThey did not want to create an anti-Lin alliance after the anti-Fang alliance.\n\nThe consequences of attacking Fang clan was already before them. If Lin clan were to imitate Fang clan as well, with a pseudo venerable bringing the whole clan to fight a guerrilla war, how Western Desert’s righteous path possibly survive?\n\n“It is impossible for Fang clan to make a move. Seems like the previous series of Fang clan’s attacks was a deception created by Heavenly Court.” It was clear to Fang Yuan after he read through the whole information.\n\nAfter Fang clan lost all their resource points, they had to rely on Fang Yuan even more. So, Fang Yuan had an even deeper control over them. If Fang clan were to attack at such a large scale, it was impossible for them to not notify him and ask for his instructions.\n\nFang Yuan found it somewhat funny.\n\nHeavenly Court tried to put their hands in Western Desert, it would have been okay if they chose anyone else, but they just happened to choose the strongest target!\n\nBut shortly after, Fang Yuan fell into deep thought.\n\nHe thought of an issue: ”Why did Heavenly Court suddenly target Lin clan?”\n\nWas it because they discovered Lin clan’s first supreme elder’s pseudo venerable strength and wanted to get rid of him in advance for their plan to conquest the five regions?\n\nThis possibility was too low.\n\nNot to mention that the greatest obstacle to Heavenly Court ruling the five regions were the other venerables, pseudo venerables were inconsequential.\n\nAlso, even if Heavenly Court discovered that Lin clan’s first supreme elder had pseudo venerable battle strength, why would they only send five Heavenly Court Gu Immortals to kill him?\n\nThis was clearly not reasonable.\n\n“What is Heavenly Court’s true motive? Why did they suddenly target Lin clan?”\n\nFang Yuan knew from Fang clan that Lin clan had never colluded with Fang clan.\n\nThis was just Heavenly Court framing them!\n\n“Is it because Lin Jian Xing is an otherworldly demon?”\n\nThat was not right either.\n\nHeavenly Court’s stance towards otherworldly demons was not radical extermination.\n\nIf they could be recruited, Heavenly Court would recruit them. They had tried to recruit Fang Yuan as well.\n\nHeavenly Court’s recruitment standard was very clear—they just needed to be humans!\n\n“So what was the reason? As the number one person in wisdom path, even if Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not make the plan, she must have agreed to attacking Lin clan. But she rarely miscalculates, so what was it that made her agree to attacking Lin clan?”\n\nThis question was crucial and was worth pondering over.\n\nEven though wisdom Gu was only at rank eight, it was helpful to Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter he used all kinds of wisdom path methods, Fang Yuan had some guesses but he was not certain.\n\nAfter all, they were only deductions.\n\nWhat was the truth?\n\nFang Yuan naturally had a way to verify his deductions.\n\nHe immediately sent an order to make a rank five Gu Master undergo immortal ascension.\n\nCurrently, there was no such rank five Gu Immortal seed in sovereign immortal aperture. Moreover, these Gu Immortal seeds did not have deep foundation or enough experience, the possibility of them succeeding in immortal ascension was very low. This was why Fang Yuan decided to stop them to let them continue to deepen their foundation.\n\nBut because this issue was very important, Fang Yuan felt it was worth expending a rank five Gu Master.\n\nIn the end, this rank five Gu Master failed and died from the imbalance of three qi.\n\nBut using the short period of time of merging the three qi, Fang Yuan used stealing heavenly secret to explore the truth.\n\nAlthough Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was outside of Heavenly Court, being in Embroidered Tower, when she gave order to attack Lin clan, Bo Qing’s soul was taken out from Heavenly Court’s secret storage.\n\nThis was obvious evidence!\n\nAdding on that Fairy Maiden Soul modified Bo Qing’s soul in Heavenly Court, Fang Yuan learned of many valuable information.\n\n“Fairy Zi Wei and Ying Wu Xie are trapped in heaven path dream realms, so Star Constellation Immortal Venerable decided to cultivate Bo Qing even though this action carries risks.”\n\nWith these clues, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s goal was obvious, it was to use Bo Qing to scheme against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable.\n\n“Spectral Soul Demon Venerable…”\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shone darkly as he mumbled.\n\nHe knew why Star Constellation Immortal Venerable wanted to deal with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s actions already made him the main threat to Heavenly Court.\n\nNaturally, this was Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s understanding under the condition of Fang Yuan hiding his situation.\n\nWere the truth of Fang Yuan’s many rank nine Immortal Gu to be revealed, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable would be thrown aside, not only would Star Constellation Immortal Venerable find trouble with Fang Yuan, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable would also impatiently ally with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to attack Fang Yuan!\n\nSplash splash splash.\n\nAt this time, Fang Yuan made deductions rapidly, thoughts gushed in his mind and formed into torrential waves.\n\nHe knew an opportunity was before him.\n\nA huge opportunity!\n\nIf he missed this chance, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable might succeed in her plan.\n\nSuch opportunities seldom came twice.\n\nSo would he be able to grasp this opportunity?\n\nIf he could not, the outcome would be extremely bad to Fang Yuan.\n\nFang Yuan could not decide immediately.\n\nAlthough he knew of heavenly court’s secret, he did not know how much progress Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had made over this period of time.\n\nHe was even more in the dark regarding Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Longevity Heaven.\n\nFang Yuan refined rank nine Immortal Gu, he had an advantage in this aspect. But the other venerables might be able to offset his refinement path advantage through other aspects.\n\nBattle.\n\nFang Yuan did not like battles, but he did not hate or reject them.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, battles and killing were only a way to obtain benefits.\n\nAn outcome of inflicting a little more damage to enemy while suffering less damage was already a good result in a battle.\n\nThere were huge risks in battle.\n\nIt was not a wise decision to start a fight rashly.\n\nCompared to fighting, Fang Yuan liked doing transactions — to plunder the economy.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was aware: There will be upcoming battles between the venerables and it will be frequent!\n\n“Lets fight then.” After pondering and considering for several days, Fang Yuan finally made this decision.\n\nAnd he immediately took action.\n\nOn one hand, he sent Gu Immortals to Western Desert to contact Lin Jian Xing and try to recruit him; on the other hand, he arranged a troop of capable experts.\n\nAfter making proper arrangements, Fang Yuan flew to the sky and entered spectral heaven!\n\nGreat Love Immortal Venerable suddenly flew into spectral heaven—this significant information was quickly obtained by Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven, it was rapidly spread throughout the whole five regions’ Gu Immortal world.\n\nEvery action of a venerable captured the attention of all the Gu Immortals.\n\nLet alone when Fang Yuan was making such a big movement!\n\n“What is Heaven Refining Demon Venerable trying to do by entering spectral heaven? Fight with Spectral Soul Demon Venerable?” Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was puzzled.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable, however, felt her heart jump.\n\nNot long ago, she had completed the transaction with Fang Yuan regarding the star array calculation formation. Her calculations went wrong because of Lin Jian Xing’s strength and she was just about to deal with this when Fang Yuan made such a strange movement.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable did not even make a deduction when a strong intuition hit her—this was going to be bad!\n\nBut as the exact situation and how this intuition was going to be realized, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable did not know. She needed to continue deducing or let the situation play out.\n\n“Among the venerables, Fang Yuan is the person in the worst position. Why did he take the initiative to go to spectral heaven?” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was also puzzled.\n\nSpectral heaven had already become Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s territory, he did not show any movements when other Gu Immortals entered or left spectral heaven.\n\nBut if a venerable like Fang Yuan entered?\n\nThis was like a tiger occupying a mountain, it would not move when some small animals stepped onto the mountain. But if another tiger entered the mountain, the tiger would become vigilant and even start a fight.\n\nWould Spectral Soul Demon Venerable attack Fang Yuan?\n\nThe reply to this issue weighed on the two venerables’ minds.\n\nThey activated their investigative killer moves to pay close attention—Spectral Soul Demon Venerable did not show any movement!\n\nBoth venerables were shaken.\n\nBoth thought of a possibility at the same time: Did Fang Yuan have a method against Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, so he had the confidence to enter spectral heaven?\n\nBut why did he suddenly enter spectral heaven?\n\nSimilar question appeared before Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable’s first thought was: ”Has Fang Yuan already settled the issues inside sovereign immortal aperture and is trying to annex variant human grotto-heavens?”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s heart jolted as the bad feeling grew in her heart: ”Does Fang Yuan already know of the heaven path dream realms? In the battle in Crazed Demon Cave, he killed Paradise Earth and obtained a large piece of truthful floating ice left after Limitless Demon Venerable’s death….”\n\nFang Yuan did not conceal his movement and directly went towards the location of heaven path dream realms after he entered spectral heaven.\n\nSoon, he was before the heaven path dream realms.\n\nAfter sensing this, Giant Sun Immortal Venerable was shaken: ”This is a dream realm? It is the dream realm closest to the depiction in <<The Legends of Ren Zu>>! So Fang Yuan’s target is them.”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable frowned, Fang Yuan had heaven path cultivation and was also the number one person in the world regarding dream path, the heaven path dream realms were too useful to him.\n\n“I can’t let Fang Yuan succeed!” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable thought of this and immediately contact Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.\n\nGiant Sun Immortal Venerable learned that these were heaven path dream realms.\n\nHe immediately agreed to ally with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to suppress Fang Yuan and stop him from obtaining heaven path dream realms. At the same time, he wondered to himself if this was real or not.\n\nThis was the first time Giant Sun Immortal Venerable knew of the heaven path dream realm’s existence.\n\n“I already have a rank nine Gu, although it is light Gu, is damaged and can’t be used for the moment, this is already enough to make Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Heaven Refining Demon Venerable ally to deal with me. So, is this situation planned by them to plot against me?”\n\nThis was definitely a possibility.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the heaven path dream realm before him and sent dream butterfly Immortal Gu inside.\n\nDream butterfly Immortal Gu was an investigative Gu, Fang Yuan soon learned the details of the heaven path dream realm.\n\nHe became quite excited: ”The price to create these heaven path dream realms is huge, the Heavenly Dao definitely expended its true meaning. This means, if I obtain these dream realms and absorb the true meaning, the loss of the Heavenly Dao will become my gain. Through this, my attainment in some aspects of heaven path can become even higher than the Heavenly Dao!”\n\nNaturally, this could not be considered as heaven path supreme grandmaster.\n\nBecause right now, there were too many things in heaven path that Fang Yuan still could not comprehend.\n\n“Fang Yuan, have you been well?” Just as he was thinking, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable arrived.\n\n“As expected, it is easy to do things secretly, but hard to do them openly. Giant Sun Immortal Venerable is probably arriving as well.” Fang Yuan thought of this and smiled at Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, ”Star Constellation, I must have these dream realms! If you don’t retreat, I will need you to die.”"
