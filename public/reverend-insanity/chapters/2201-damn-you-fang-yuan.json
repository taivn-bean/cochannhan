  "content": "Chapter 2201: Damn You, Fang Yuan!\n\nBack then, Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable had expended his own theft path dao marks to refine this gamble Gu!\n\nGamble Gu gave random results that could not be influenced by anyone.\n\nThieving Heaven Demon Venerable was special, he was an otherworldly demon who possessed otherworldly dao marks. Thieving Heaven’s space was founded on the basis of his otherworldly dao marks. Meanwhile, gamble Gu was refined with his otherworldly theft path dao marks.\n\nGamble Gu did not have any offensive power by itself, it was powerless no matter what the result was. But the luck gamble killer move that used it as the core was extremely dangerous.\n\nWhether it succeeded or failed, there was no way to predict it.\n\nBut it was because of this characteristic, even Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s luck could not interfere with it.\n\nThe probability of winning the luck gamble was equal for both Immortal Zombie Giant Sun and Qin Ding Ling.\n\nQin Ding Ling won the previous time, now, it was Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s win.\n\nHowever, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun did not feel any joy.\n\nBecause whether she lost or won, Qin Ding Ling would only profit.\n\nThe reason?\n\nIt was due to the profundity of luck path.\n\nLuck was essentially categorized into two types: good luck and bad luck. The size of luck varied from person to person; in general, the higher the cultivation, the larger the luck.\n\nComparing Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s and Qin Ding Ling’s luck.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun’s luck was extremely vast, it was at Dao Lord level. There was little bad luck, while good luck occupied the majority of it.\n\nAnd Qin Ding Ling?\n\nQin Ding Ling’s luck was far smaller than Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s. Bad luck occupied most of it, while good luck was little.\n\nQin Ding Ling was only a rank eight expert, her luck would naturally be smaller than Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s.\n\nLuck was a variable! She was against a powerful enemy like Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, with the luck of all living beings influencing each other, even if she had good luck, it would be affected and turned into bad luck.\n\nThus, firstly, Qin Ding Ling’s luck was far smaller than her opponent’s. She was basically gambling with a smaller chip, this was a huge advantage in itself.\n\nSecondly, Qin Ding Ling had a lot of bad luck, when it was transferred to Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, it would contaminate his luck as well.\n\nThe basis of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable’s combat system was positive and powerful luck. This had two crucial points, one was he needed to have vast luck, the other was that his luck needed to be positive, which meant the more good luck he had, the better.\n\nIf Qin Ding Ling won more and lost less in the luck gamble, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s luck would greatly decrease. If Qin Ding Ling won less and lost more, even though Immortal Zombie Giant Sun would obtain her luck, it would mostly contain bad luck.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun fell into a dilemma.\n\nHe had many methods to transform his bad luck into good luck. But this process would spend immortal essence and mental energy, he would be sacrificing many opportunities when he battled Star Constellation Immortal Venerable again.\n\nEven worse was that once he turned his bad luck into good luck, and he lost to Qin Ding Ling in the next luck gamble, what would he do?\n\nWould he not be reinforcing the enemy?\n\nBam bam bam…\n\nThere was a chain of self-detonations, over thirty truthful floating ice pieces were destroyed.\n\nThere was only ten percent or so remaining of the Crazed Demon formation!\n\nThe Crazed Demon formation’s power continued to weaken, there was also only about forty percent remaining of the great world in the eighth layer. Everything was used to nurture the central truthful floating ice piece.\n\nThe three Crazed Demon Eccentrics continued to carve the truthful floating ice, their expressions becoming fanatic.\n\nThe strength of Limitless’ countermeasures originated from the Crazed Demon formation. If not for this, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable or Immortal Zombie Giant Sun would have already destroyed the source of Limitless’ countermeasures.\n\nBack then, Limitless Demon Venerable had deliberately arranged it as one whole to make others hold themselves back if they wanted to obtain eternal life research results. They had to accept the threat and be indistinctly restricted by the countermeasures.\n\nAs the Crazed Demon formation continued to disappear, the upper limits of strength in the Gu Immortals’ fight continued to rise.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun used more powerful methods.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable similarly raised the strength of her skills.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun was being hindered by Qin Ding Ling, he unavoidably fell into a disadvantage.\n\n“We must kill Qin Ding Ling!” This became a general consensus.\n\nNot only Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, other pseudo venerables also attacked.\n\nBut this was Star Constellation Chessboard Formation, since Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s painstaking scheme against Immortal Zombie Giant Sun succeeded, how could she let Qin Ding Ling be attacked easily?\n\n“The situation is not good, we need to reinforce Giant Sun Immortal Venerable!”\n\n“If we want to support Giant Sun, we need to kill Qin Ding Ling. At worst, we need to disturb and break her killer move.”\n\n“But Star Constellation Chessboard Formation can transfer her anywhere instantly, so we still need to destroy this formation first!”\n\nAfter back and forth discussions, it still returned to the starting point.\n\nSwoosh swoosh swoosh!\n\nStars shot forward one after the other, destroying the protective golden light, and forcing Immortal Zombie Giant Sun to retreat.\n\nGuh.\n\nHe coughed out cold, dark corpse blood. Starlight shone on his chest, no matter how his golden light spread, the starlight was still shining brightly. His injuries were very heavy!\n\nBecause of Qin Ding Ling impeding him, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s battle strength had fallen sharply. He was actually showing signs of defeat in the battle with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable!\n\nLooking at Immortal Zombie Giant Sun coughing blood, the expressions of Lu Wei Yin and the others changed.\n\nWas Immortal Zombie Giant Sun going to lose in the battle of two venerables?\n\nThe previous battle situation already proved that Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was the strongest battle strength in the allied forces, second was Gu Yue Fang Yuan. If Immortal Zombie Giant Sun were to be defeated, that would mean the allied forces lost!\n\nHowever, no matter how unwilling Lu Wei Yin and the rest were, they were aware that it was normal for Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to have such an advantage.\n\nThere were many factors that influenced a fight between Gu Immortals.\n\nOne was cultivation level and number of dao marks. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun were equal in this.\n\nSecond was immortal essence and Immortal Gu. Both sides were about the same.\n\nThird was battle experience. It was a draw between Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun.\n\nFourth was external environment, whether it could be used or not. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable exceeded Immortal Zombie Giant Sun in this aspect, at least, it was true for the moment.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun used Luck Suppression Heavenly Palace, Calamity Luck Altar, and Savage Wilderness Great World. He then allied with Fang Yuan, deliberately destroyed Primordial Domain, then allied with Fang Yuan again to explore the Crazed Demon formation and the Door of Life and Death.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable fought many battles using the strength of Book Mountain, Primordial Domain, Crazed Demon formation, immortal graveyard, Door of Life and Death, Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, Green Lotus Great World, Star Constellation Chessboard, and Limitless’ countermeasures.\n\nFifth were combat methods. Gu formations, battlefield killer moves, Gu houses, and all kinds of killer moves. Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun were both excellent beyond doubt in this aspect, it was hard to tell who was better.\n\nSixth was combat system.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun’s combat system contained extremely powerful potential for later, but it was miraculously cracked by Qin Ding Ling.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable also possessed an exceptional combat system which she had been using all along.\n\nThis combat system was the combined combat systems of Ming Hao, Yu Xiu, and Feng Ya.\n\nIn the offensive aspect, the main method was Fairy Ming Hao’s flying star killer move.\n\nWisdom path Gu Immortals often used exquisite killer moves because of the superiority of their path. These killer moves usually contained many Gu worms and had complicated procedures for activation. This was why the calculation ability of wisdom path Gu Immortals was extraordinary, only then could they control their killer moves properly.\n\nBut in Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s combat system, the flying star method was almost the only method in the offensive aspect, it could be said to be extremely lacking and unvaried!\n\nWas Star Constellation Immortal Venerable intentionally throwing away the obvious advantage of wisdom path?\n\nThat was not the case.\n\nFirst of all, the killer move flying star looked simple but that was not true. If it was used repeatedly one after the other, every move would be a consecutive move. Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was hit by so many stars that by now, the injuries caused by the stars had reached the point of inflicting serious injuries.\n\nSecondly, the deficiency in the offensive aspect was exactly Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s ingenuity.\n\nLooking at the whole combat system, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable took out the calculation requirement from the offense aspect and transferred it onto herself, letting her have an immense grasp over the battle situation at all times!\n\nIt was because of this grasp over the situation that Star Constellation Immortal Venerable could use all the surrounding resources to the limit, even as the weak side, she could win against the strong, against the strong alliance army that had high numbers, she actually led Heavenly Court to the height of victory.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable’s combat system could use the environment to suppress enemies and use emotions to affect them. Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was one of the victims.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun and Star Constellation Immortal Venerable were equal in many aspects. However, in this deadlock, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s combat system was obstructed, while Star Constellation Immortal Venerable continued to maintain her combat system and her advantages.\n\nThese advantages were insignificant alone, but they stacked together until Immortal Zombie Giant Sun fell into the danger of losing!\n\n“Fang Yuan, it is time to stake our lives and fight, what are you still hesitating for?!” Immortal Zombie Giant Sun suddenly shot towards the azure sphere.\n\nLuck path killer moves erupted like a rainstorm, attempting to break the sphere and release Fang Yuan.\n\nBut Star Constellation Immortal Venerable was already guarded against this. She immediately attacked, star shadows flickered, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun suffered a heavy attack again, his killer move was also destroyed halfway.\n\n“We must help Fang Yuan, he will reinforce Giant Sun Immortal Venerable.” Lu Wei Yin called out.\n\nParadise Earth sighed: “Sigh, if my tomb had not been destroyed, I would have venerable cultivation level now and be able to resolve this predicament.”\n\n“These damned fodder!” Zhan Bu Du waved his punch, killing another Heavenly Court member. However, these Heavenly Court Gu Immortals would revive shortly afterwards, there was no way to kill them completely.\n\nWhat’s more, there was still Qi Sea Ancestor behind Zhan Bu Du.\n\nHalf of the Limitless’ chains on Qi Sea Ancestor had already disappeared.\n\nOn one hand, other Gu Immortals were helping him, on the other hand, the Crazed Demon formation itself was shrinking. The upper limit of strength in the Gu Immortals’ fights was continuously increasing, there was now a much higher tolerance for the killer move Hu elevation.\n\nHowever, Qi Sea Ancestor still did not have the strength to protect himself, he required Zhan Bu Du’s constant protection.\n\n“Everyone, protect me!” Paradise Earth shouted, retreating to the center of the group.\n\nThe other immortals protected him and gave Paradise Earth precious time to use his killer move.\n\nHeaven path killer move — Heavenly Summary Earthly Norm.\n\nA mysterious aura spread from his body and charged towards the azure sphere like an air wave.\n\nThis killer move was extremely profound, it could restore heaven and earth to its normal state, it was the nemesis of battlefield killer moves.\n\nIt was perfect to break the encirclement!\n\nThe azure sphere was already enduring the pressure from Fang Yuan, now that the killer move heavenly summary earthly norm hit, it immediately collapsed.\n\nFang Yuan gave a loud shout, as he flew out like a tiger let out of its cage.\n\n“Paradise Earth, I hope you can lend me a hand again!” Fang Yuan sent out a multi-colored rainbow, taking Paradise Earth as he charged towards Qin Ding Ling!\n\nHeaven path killer move — Heavenly Summary Earthly Norm!\n\nParadise Earth took in a deep breath, after using the killer move, his orifices started bleeding, his face became pale as paper.\n\nFormless air currents moved forward, everywhere they went, starry paths broke down, turning into nothingness.\n\nWithout the starry paths, it was difficult for Star Constellation Immortal Venerable to move Qin Ding Ling.\n\nHer eyes flickered with cold light, she immediately gave up on rescuing Qin Ding Ling and fiercely attacked Immortal Zombie Giant Sun instead.\n\n“Damn you, Fang Yuan!” Immortal Zombie Giant Sun roared, his chest was torn from the attack and his soul was heavily injured.\n\nAt this time, Qin Ding Ling was killed by Fang Yuan.\n\nHowever, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun could not turn the situation around. Thousands of stardust shot towards him, he destroyed most of them but several hundreds still struck his body.\n\nSo much starlight accumulated in Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s injuries that they were already intense like fire!\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun was close to death.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable continued to attack him ruthlessly.\n\nThe final fatal attack!"
