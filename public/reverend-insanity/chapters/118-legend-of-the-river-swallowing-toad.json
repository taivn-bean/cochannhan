  "content": "Chapter 118: Legend of the River Swallowing Toad\n\n**Translator:** Skyfarrow **Editor:** Skyfarrow\n\nIt is said that every single River Swallowing Toad’s stomach carries a river.\n\nFang Yuan did not use the River Swallowing Toad in his previous life, but he has a strong impression of this Gu, because of one person.\n\nA normal person, a family servant.\n\nAround two hundred years later in his previous life, a very special Gu Master will appear— Jiang Fan.\n\nHis existence shocked numerous Gu Masters, and his story would be spread around by the mortals.\n\nOnce he appeared, he became a legend.\n\nHis entire success was attributed to a River Swallowing Toad.\n\nJiang Fan was a mere family servant, single-handedly taking care of a fishery for his master. One day, a River Swallowing Toad arrived at the coast with its belly side up, lying in the water, asleep the entire time.\n\nJiang Fan was initially scared and shocked, but slowly, he felt that this toad was dead, why was it not moving at all?\n\nThe “toad corpse” blocked the upflow of the river water, and this caused many problems for Jiang Fan who was taking care of the fishery.\n\nJiang Fan tried many different methods and ways to move this “toad corpse” away. But he was just a mere mortal, how could he move something as heavy as the River Swallowing Toad?\n\nHis master was stingy and cruel, and if he could not meet the monthly quota, his head will be decapitated. Jiang Fan did not dare to report it, as someone not too long ago did not manage to fulfill his quota and reported it with a proper reason, but ended up getting killed on the spot.\n\nSeeing that the due date was getting closer, and the corpse still remained there blocking the water, it greatly affected his revenue. Gradually, Jiang Fan became more frightened, and his temper became more abusive and frustrated.\n\nAlthough he knew that he could not move this corpse away, he would still go to it everyday, to punch and kick the “toad corpse”, crying and making a din. Letting go of all the fear and anger he had in the face of death.\n\nBut one day, the River Swallowing Toad woke up, and with its half-opened eyes, stared at Jiang Fan.\n\nJiang Fan’s legs went soft from the shock.\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad was half asleep and half awake, but it still laid there like it was a “corpse”. After some time, Jiang Fan regained his composure.\n\nHe was not afraid, he was going to die anyway, what is there to be afraid of?\n\nHe climbed to the top of the River Swallowing Toad’s belly, and lied down face up. Staring at the sky, “Toad, oh toad. You are the same as me, with only one last breath left in you, you’re about to die too huh?”\n\nHe did not know about the characteristics of the River Swallowing Toad. Looking at its half dead state, he thought that it was going to die. After saying so, Jiang Fan’s face flooded with tears.\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad squinted its eyes, listening to Jiang Fan’s words while staring at the sky.\n\nFor the next few days, he continued to lie on the River Swallowing Toad’s white and soft belly, crying while talking, complaining about the pain and the repressed feelings of a mortal.\n\nFinally, the deadline was here. The person-in-charge came down from the village to the fishery to collect the fish.\n\nWhere could Jiang Fan find fish to meet the quota? Left with no choice, he could only give an excuse that he needed to do some packing, and ran to the River Swallowing Toad to bid farewell.\n\nHe patted the River Swallowing Toad’s belly, “Old toad, to think that I’m going to die first. It must be affinity that led to me knowing you. I hope that in your remaining days, you will have a better life.”\n\nAt this moment, the River Swallowing Toad started move.\n\nJiang Fan was taken aback. Seeing that the River Swallowing Toad’s actions were becoming larger, he quickly jumped off.\n\nPlop!\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad turned around, with its belly side down and back facing upwards. It had fully woken up.\n\nJiang Fan’s body was drenched, and on having seen this scene he became angry and stomped his foot, “Old toad, oh old toad, so you can still move? Ahhhh, you have caused my death, if you had moved a few days ago, I would not have to die!”\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad ignored his words, it had just woken up and felt hungry.\n\nHalf of its body was submerged into the water as it opened its mouth, starting to suck in the river water in order to sate its hunger.\n\nSeeing this, Jiang Fan was dumbfounded. He shockingly saw that the water level was receding, dropping at an observable pace, rapidly falling.\n\nLarge amounts of river water were swallowed into the toad’s belly, but its belly did not even expand a bit, it was almost like a bottomless hole.\n\nA moment later, the River Swallowing Toad stopped its meal. The river water had already dropped to an extreme level, and the bedrock was exposed. If a person stood in the river, the water would only reach their knees.\n\nJiang Fan stood at the coast, at a lost for words.\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad glanced at him and suddenly burped. Its stomach expanded and contracted, its mouth opening wide as it and it vomited out a large amount of seafood.\n\nFish, prawn, turtle, crab, snails, eels, everything!\n\nThe River Swallowing Toad only ate water as its food, but did not consume these seafood, hence it vomited all of them out.\n\nAt this point, it seems like it was raining seafood.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the seafood gathered into a mountain, and Jiang Fan upon seeing this, was overwhelming exhilarated. He screamed loudly, “I’m saved, I’m saved! These seafood is enough for me to hand up for three months. Old toad, oh old toad, it is all thanks to you!”\n\nHe packaged those seafood, and quickly handed them to the person-in-charge.\n\nThe person-in-charge was both shocked and suspicious, how could there be so much? He quickly reported it, and the Gu Masters in the village also found out that the water level had changed drastically.\n\nAfter investigating, they found out about the River Swallowing Toad’s existence.\n\nIt was a Rank five Gu!\n\nThe village fell into a panic and they formed into large groups, trying to expel the River Swallowing Toad.\n\nJiang Fan did not want the River Swallowing Toad to be harmed; these days he had treated the River Swallowing Toad as his only friend.\n\nHe kneeled in front of the Gu Masters and pleaded hysterically. But why would Gu Masters care about a mere mortal? They kicked him aside and were about to murder him.\n\nBut at this moment, the River Swallowing Toad arrived.\n\nNobody knew if it had treated Jiang Fan as its friend, or felt that being with Jiang Fan was interesting and could cure boredom.\n\nThe point is, it struck.\n\nIt carried Jiang Fan and vomited out a stream of river water that engulfed the whole village and drowned half the hill.\n\nThis battle startled the entire southern continent!\n\nThereafter, Jiang Fan’s name spread throughout the one hundred thousand mountains. With the River Swallowing Toad staying by his side, it meant that he owned a Rank five Gu worm!\n\nAfter all, even a Rank five Gu Master, might not have a Rank five Gu worm.\n\nRank five Gu Masters were rare, even in the Gu Yue clan’s history, there were only two people — the first generation clan leader and the fourth generation clan leader.\n\nBut he Jiang Fan did not have an awakened aperture, yet as a mere mortal he had a River Swallowing Toad.\n\nHis existence stunned the entire Gu Master world.\n\nAfter that, Jiang Fan built a hamlet at the village’s location. He was endearing to people and sympathized with mortals, aspiring to reach equality among all people. It was a village without oppression.\n\nHe became a flag, and the mortals in the surrounding villages came to him and wanted to depend on him.\n\nBut eventually, he was still assassinated.\n\nWith just a River Swallowing Toad, it could not make him truly powerful. He was not a Gu Master after all, and after his death, the River Swallowing Toad left.\n\nGu Masters razed his hamlet to the grounds, and slaughtered the mortals who dared to oppose them.\n\nWith his mortal self, Jiang Fan challenged the entire system of society, and that brought forth the rage of the Gu Masters.\n\n“I wonder if Jiang Fan will still appear this time after my influence.” After his recollection, Fang Yuan laughed.\n\nBut Chi Shan could not laugh.\n\nHis face was grim as he returned.\n\nThe villagers at the mountain foot were waiting for the Gu Masters to deal with this problem.\n\nBut the great Gu Yue Chi Shan arrived and still could not solve the issue. This caused the villagers to panic, and the panic spread and reached a high point.\n\nThey dragged their families, brought big and small bags, and rushed up to the village. They naturally did not dare to step inside, thus more and more villagers kneeled outside the village’s doors, begging the Gu Masters to have mercy and let them in.\n\nIn the hall.\n\n“What? These lowly commoners dare to surround the main gate. Atrocious, they are getting more and more daring, kill, kill them all!” The punishment hall clan elder screamed.\n\nMedicine hall’s Gu Yue Yao Ji’s face was also grim, “Although these lowly commoners deserve death, killing a few is enough to threaten the rest and chase the group away, but it would be like a joke for the other villages to observe.”\n\nGu Yue Chi Lian said, “The important thing now is not this. If even Chi Shan cannot wake this River Swallowing Toad, who else in our clan can? It seems we have to get reinforcements, the Xiong clan specializes in strength.” He sighed and continued, “for the safety of the clan, we should get them to do it. Even if we have to pay a price, it is worth it.”\n\nThese words got the consent of the other clan elders, and even clan leader Gu Yue Bo was moved.\n\n“Clan leader and the other clan elders, this junior has something to report.” Gu Yue Chi Shan had been standing in the hall, listening to the clan elders, but suddenly he bowed and said spoke.\n\nGu Yue Bo nodded, he had an appreciative attitude towards Gu Yue Chi Shan, “Chi Shan, if you have any ideas, you might as well say it.”\n\nChi Shan asked instead, “Elders, to push this River Swallowing Toad awake, does it really need one person’s strength?”\n\nGu Yue Bo said, “According to the previous clan leader’s words, the River Swallowing Toad has a mild temper and loves to sleep. Even if it is awakened by someone pushing it, it would not rage. Thus, we asked you who has the greatest strength in the village to wake it. But it ended in failure.”\n\nChi Shan said, “Then can clan leader grant me a Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu? With one bull’s strength and my inborn strength, I would be able to push this River Swallowing Toad awake.”\n\n“You definitely cannot use a Gu worm’s strength.” Just as Chi Shan finished speaking, a clan elder denied his request, “A Gu worm’s aura will invite the vigilance of the River Swallowing Toad. If this causes it to feel threatened and rampage about, who would face the consequences?”\n\n“That’s right.” Gu Yue Bo nodded, “By using a Gu worm, even if we wake up the toad, we cannot get its approval. It has to be a single person, using his own strength to wake it and get its approval.”\n\nGu is the spirit of heaven and earth, but it behaved more like wild beasts. Wild beasts have their territories, and roaming wild beasts when encountering the king of a territory, would have a battle. The victorious takes the territory and the loser roams.\n\nThe formation of a beast tide is also based on this wild beast instinct. Strong beast groups will invade and conquer neighbouring land. Weaker groups would be exiled and this forms the beast tide.\n\nTo chase the River Swallowing Toad away, they have to abide to its habits.\n\nRiver Swallowing Toad has a mild temperament, not enjoying conflict, and as long as the territory’s “beast king” can be recognised, it would leave.\n\nThus, using Gu worms is a no-no, the Gu worm’s aura will be sensed and cause the River Swallowing Toad to take unpredictable actions. Using everyone’s strength was not possible too. Once there are many people, even if it is moved, the toad would not leave.\n\nThat is because everyone acting together was not fair, and would not be recognised by it.\n\nThus, the clan leader got Chi Shan to go ahead, as he had the greatest strength in the village.\n\n“So that’s it, I understand.” Chi Shan finally understood the situation, he cupped his fists, “In that case, I will recommend someone to the clan elders, he has greater strength than me.”\n\n“Oh, who?”\n\n“There’s such a person, why did we not know?”\n\n“Chi Shan, don’t keep us waiting, quickly say it!”\n\n“This person, is Gu Yue Fang Yuan.” Chi Shan said a name."
