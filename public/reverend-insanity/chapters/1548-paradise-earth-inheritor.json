Quickly disrupt him!” Lang Ya land spirit screamed as he ordered in anxiety.\n\nNext, he added: “But be careful, don’t destroy wisdom Gu!”\n\nEven without his reminder, the variant human Gu Immortals from the three races knew how important this rank nine Immortal Gu was.\n\nBut now, to disrupt Feng Jiu Ge while not affecting the wisdom Gu close by, they needed intense control and it was quite difficult for these variant human Gu Immortals who had just started using this immortal formation.\n\nThe variant human Gu Immortals had to forcefully manipulate the immortal formation as they attacked Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge grunted as he used song warrior.\n\nThe obtain treasure song warrior flew towards wisdom Gu, while the other song warriors helped Feng Jiu Ge to block the attacks of the immortal formation.\n\nThe variant human Gu Immortals attacked with excessive force that implicated wisdom Gu, but Feng Jiu Ge would block them and defend wisdom Gu.\n\nWisdom Gu sensed danger, its survival instinct made it fly away.\n\nObtain treasure song warrior followed behind it but could not produce any effects.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge saw this, his heart sank. Wisdom Gu was rank nine, even though obtain treasure song was good, it was only rank eight, it could not affect wisdom Gu.\n\n“If I cannot get it, should I destroy it?” This thought emerged in Feng Jiu Ge’s mind before he denied it.\n\nThis was rank nine wisdom Gu, destroying it was a big waste.\n\nAnd this Immortal Gu was formally the vital Gu of Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, if he could get it, it would greatly benefit Feng Jiu Ge, the Central Continent ten great ancient sects, as well as Heavenly Court.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was unresigned, he did not want to give up.\n\n“Don’t go.” Feng Jiu Ge pounced at wisdom Gu.\n\nWisdom Gu flew rapidly, but Feng Jiu Ge pursued it endlessly.\n\nWisdom Gu felt the threat of Feng Jiu Ge as it buzzed, emitting a strong light.\n\nThe light of wisdom.\n\nFeng Jiu Ge was unavoidably covered by this light of wisdom, instantly, countless thoughts appeared in his mind and collided, his intelligence surged, his gaze became incredibly sharp.\n\nAll of the questions and difficulties he had in cultivation were all resolving, even though he did not get immediate answers, many crucial bottlenecks were easily broken through.\n\n“Oh no!” Feng Jiu Ge was a legendary figure after all, after several breaths of time in the light of wisdom, he sensed something amiss. He bit his tongue as he forced himself to snap out of it and retreated.\n\nAfter leaving the light of wisdom, he watched the escaping wisdom Gu with lingering fear.\n\n“What an amazing wisdom Gu, after this short period, I already lost so much lifespan!” A strand of Feng Jiu Ge’s hair had turned white.\n\n“My mission here is to capture Gu Yue Fang Zheng and reclaim Dang Hun Mountain, these were all instructed by Fairy Zi Wei. But to think that the rank nine wisdom Gu was hiding here! I already tried my best, but I cannot bring this Gu away. Lang Ya blessed land is also incapable of refining this wisdom Gu, otherwise, they would have done that already!”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge’s thoughts moved rapidly.\n\nImmortal Gu were unique.\n\nA wild Immortal Gu had deep attraction to any Gu Immortal.\n\nAnd it was a rank nine wild Immortal Gu in front of Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nAnd most importantly, this Immortal Gu was actually wisdom Gu!\n\n“If they refined wisdom Gu, I would not be able to snatch it. But now, it is wild. I need to go back and inform Heavenly Court and the sect about this. The next time we attack Lang Ya blessed land, we must get this Gu!”\n\nFeng Jiu Ge breathed in deeply, he looked at wisdom Gu which was already at the edge of his vision with lingering desire as he used an immortal killer move.\n\nThis immortal killer move that used rank seven Fixed Immortal Travel as the core was called, ‘human come human go’, it was created by the space path great expert Liang Liang. Feng Jiu Ge was not familiar with this move, but it had an incredible effect.\n\nOnce activated, not only could it transport people to anywhere in the world, they could also return the same way back. The first half was hard, but the second half was extremely easy.\n\nLiang Liang had already activated this successfully, Feng Jiu Ge was only completing the second half with ease.\n\nSwoosh.\n\nWith a soft sound, Feng Jiu Ge vanished.\n\nAfter a few breaths of time, Lang Ya land spirit mobilized the silver giant and arrived.\n\n“Damn it, Feng Jiu Ge, you actually ran away! Central Continent’s ten great ancient sects, I won’t let you off!” Lang Ya land spirit looked at the tattered Lang Ya blessed land as he shouted angrily, roaring.\n\nSouthern Border, inside the immortal battlefield killer move.\n\nLu Wei Yin sighed deeply.\n\nThree lifetimes were over, but Fang Yuan was not reformed.\n\n“I was wrong!”\n\n“I thought that this Fang Yuan was a heartless person or was filled with hatred and rage, that was the reason for his evil actions.”\n\n“But the truth is, he has abundant emotions, he does not lack anything. Even though he pursues strength, he is not obsessed with it.”\n\n“What drives him to do this is his goal. This goal is deeply ingrained in his heart, not only three lifetimes, even after a hundred lifetimes, it cannot be eradicated.”\n\n“This person cannot be reformed.”\n\n“Master…” Ye Fan muttered lightly.\n\nAt this time, not just him, even Shang Xin Ci and the rest, including Tie Mian Shen and the other Gu Immortals had woken up.\n\nEveryone was in a daze after three lifetimes, they were savoring the mystical feeling behind it.\n\nLu Wei Yin looked around as his gaze paused on Shang Xin Ci for a moment.\n\nHer eyes were red, she almost cried, her sadness was evident. She had been emotionally connected to Fang Yuan during the three lifetimes.\n\nLu Wei Yin nodded secretly, saying to everyone: “I failed, this demon cannot be stopped, he is about to break out of the killer move and escape, let’s go.”\n\nYe Fan was shocked: “Master, we have the clear advantage.”\n\nLu Wei Yin smiled bitterly: “I’ve already tried my best, let’s go.”\n\nThe mortal Gu Masters were confused, but Tie Mian Shen and the two Yi clan Gu Immortals had their suspicions.\n\nTie Mian Shen asked directly: “Senior’s surname is Lu, and you are skilled in earth path, are you the inheritor of Paradise Earth’s true inheritance?”\n\nLu Wei Yin nodded: “That’s me.”\n\n“So it was like that.” Yi clan’s Gu Immortals sighed, they paid their respects and greeted Lu Wei Yin.\n\nAt the same time, they no longer had any suspicions towards Lu Wei Yin’s words.\n\nParadise Earth Immortal Venerable did not have a single offensive method, his Paradise Earth true inheritance was the same. Lu Wei Yin was skilled at trapping and reforming enemies, this was the specialty of Paradise Earth true inheritance.\n\nAmong the ten venerables, Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable was the kindest and most merciful, he singlehandedly healed the world and stopped the chaos after Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s rule.\n\nBut for some reason, this Immortal Venerable did not choose to go to Heavenly Court, he stayed in Southern Border and even left his Paradise Earth true inheritance here."
