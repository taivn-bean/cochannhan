  "content": "Chapter 807: People Who Refuse to be Ordinary\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\n\\>, Chapter Three, Section Eighteen states:\n\nRen Zu stepped on his own road of life, he left the door of life and death, but ended up in ordinary abyss.\n\nHe walked around in the bottom of the abyss, moving forward aimlessly, after a long time, even though he wanted to get out of ordinary abyss, he could not find the exit.\n\nIn his anguish, cognition Gu gave him pointers: “Human, oh human, you walked in the footsteps of other existences, although this road is simple and safe, if you want to become extraordinary, and walk out of ordinary abyss, there is little hope if you follow other people’s trails. Since you walked on your own road of life, all the difficulties need to be challenged by you personally, you need to innovate and carve out your own footprints.”\n\nAfter Ren Zu received this advice, he came to a realization, he was overjoyed as he followed cognition Gu’s instructions.\n\nHe walked out of the footsteps that already existed, he started to step on the ground that was not too firm.\n\nThe ground of ordinary abyss was not easy to walk on.\n\nSome places were swampy, it was easy to get stuck in the mud, and the stench was foul. Some places were full of thorns, sharp pointy tips were everywhere, Ren Zu was full of injuries. In some parts of the ground, there were also blade Gu. When Ren Zu stepped on the ground, his soles were injured by the sharp blades, his injuries became larger as blood flowed, when he walked, the pain could be felt striking deep within himself.\n\nThe injuries on his feet caused huge pain, Ren Zu decided to walk softly.\n\nBut as he walked, Ren Zu lost his way in ordinary abyss, many times, he would end up on the same route, and waste extra effort traversing the same path.\n\nRen Zu gradually found out this problem, he was perplexed.\n\nHow could he not lose his way in the abyss?\n\nCognition Gu told him: “Ren Zu, if you do not want to lose your way, that is entirely up to you. You were afraid of pain, thus you walked softly, the footprints you created were too shallow. When ordinary winds blow in this ordinary abyss, mortal dust will be blown out, and when the dust settles, your footprints will be covered up. If you do not want to lose your way, you have to leave behind deep footprints, do you understand what I am saying?”\n\nRen Zu nodded, he understood.\n\nThus, he started to walk using heavy steps, each time, he stepped hard onto the ground, creating a deep footprint.\n\nThis way, every step he walked would have a deep and clear marking left by him. As long as Ren Zu saw these markings, he would know that these routes were already explored, and that there was no exit to ordinary abyss there.\n\nBut good things did not last, after a while, even the deepest footprints would be covered up by the dust.\n\nRen Zu was extremely troubled, he asked cognition Gu.\n\nCognition Gu gave him another suggestion: “Oh human, even though you left deep footprints, you purposely avoided those thorns and blades. Every time you saw them, you would take a detour, this will not do. You cannot ask to be extraordinary while leading a comfortable life.”\n\nRen Zu got the hint and gritted his teeth, he purposely walked on the paths filled with thorns and blades.\n\nEvery time he took a step, he would leave a deep footprint behind, no matter how painful it was, no matter how deep the scar was.\n\nHis sweat and blood seeped into the ordinary soil as he stepped heavily into it.\n\nWhen he left his foot and moved forward, on his footprint, there would be a small stem of grass.\n\nThe name of this grass was — accomplishment.\n\nIn each of his footprints, there would be a small stem of grass.\n\nThe stems of grass did not fall when the wind blew, they could not be buried under dust, they grow stubbornly and could be preserved for much longer than the footprints.\n\n“This way, I would not need to be afraid of losing my way.” Ren Zu was overjoyed, he gritted his teeth and endured the pain, he tenaciously walked on a road filled with thorns and blades, he was not afraid of bleed or perspiring.\n\nHe walked further and further, he no longer lost his way, he no longer walked in circles, he went into uncharted territories.\n\nHe used his blood and sweat to nourish the grass under him, they started growing with more vitality and became taller.\n\nGradually, it was no longer grass that grew from his footprints, they had turned into accomplishment trees.\n\nAs time passed, the small trees grew into larger trees, the leaves were lush and green, they were even bearing fruits.\n\nRen Zu was tired from walking, he leaned on a tree for rest, he ate the sweet and juicy fruits to recover his stamina.\n\nAs time passed, he had almost walked in every corner of ordinary abyss, he created a huge forest spanning everywhere he had traveled.\n\nRen Zu looked at the forest behind him and felt bliss and joy, but even when the forest covered the entirety of ordinary abyss, he did not find the way out of it.\n\nHe felt anxious and disappointed.\n\nHe plucked one fruit and put it in his mouth, the fruit no longer tasted sweet, instead, it was bitter and hard to swallow.\n\nRen Zu felt strange, he tried to find the reason and realized: Unknowingly, there had been a second heart growing in his body.\n\nThis heart was called discontent.\n\nWith this, anything that he ate would not taste sweet.\n\nRen Zu ate the bitter fruit as he looked at the boundless forest, he no longer felt joy or bliss.\n\nAt this time, his original heart, the heart of loneliness, spoke in self Gu’s voice: “Oh human, I have thought about a way to leave the abyss. You can plant a tall and grand accomplishment tree, as long as this tree is taller than ordinary abyss, you will be able to leave this place by climbing onto this tree.”\n\nRen Zu thought about it and his eyes shined: “That’s right, that is a good idea.”\n\nBut he was troubled again: “But how can I plant a tree that is so grand, taller than ordinary abyss?”\n\nSelf Gu said: “You used the blood from your feet to plant this forest, these are all ordinary trees. If you use the blood from your heart, you should be able to plant a great accomplishment tree. Buried under the ground of ordinary abyss are many blades, why don’t you use these blades to stab into your heart, the heart blood that flows out can be used to water the trees.”\n\nRen Zu tried the method that self Gu said.\n\nThe blade stabbed into his heart, it caused an immense pain.\n\nThis pain was hundreds and thousands of times greater than the ones in his body.\n\nEventually, the trees that were watered grew tall and large, they were much larger than the original trees.\n\nRen Zu felt pain but also joy, he continued to stab more blades into his heart, causing more heart blood to flow out.\n\nThe more blades he stabbed, the more heart blood flowed out, and the larger the trees he planted.\n\nBut even the tallest accomplishment tree was only half the height of ordinary abyss.\n\nRen Zu continued to persevere, as hope Gu accompanied him.\n\nWhen the crown of the tree he planted reach the same height as ordinary abyss, the trunk of the tree cracked open, inside, a girl came out.\n\n“Father, father!” The girl went into Ren Zu’s embrace, she was very adorable.\n\nThis was Ren Zu’s fourth child, called Boundless Forest Samsara.\n\nRen Zu was also overjoyed, he played around with his daughter. When Boundless Forest Samsara was hungry, he would get her fruits to eat.\n\n“So sweet, so sweet.” Boundless Forest Samsara loved to eat fruits, she became healthy and well-fed.\n\nShe played in the forest every day, feeling immense joy.\n\nRen Zu still wanted to walk out of the ordinary abyss, Boundless Forest Samsara urged him many times: “Father, why must you exhaust yourself? Isn’t staying here great, there are trees to shelter us, fruits to feed us, we can play here forever, life will be peaceful until we die of old age.”\n\nRen Zu shook his head, his attitude was firm, he planted an even greater tree and the branches of the trees left ordinary abyss completely.\n\nBoundless Forest Samsara cried, she held onto Ren Zu’s hands as she pleaded: “Father, don’t abandon me. I cannot climb trees, if you go, I will be left here alone, I do not know how to plant trees, there are limited fruits, one day, I will die of hunger.”\n\nRen Zu said: “Why would I abandon you? You are my daughter, I will carry you and leave this place.”\n\nThus, the father and daughter climbed the tree.\n\nThe higher they went, the more exhausted Ren Zu felt. Boundless Forest Samsara was a heavy burden, even without her, climbing the tree alone was very dangerous, not to mention carrying a person who could not climb the tree at all.\n\nThe bigger problem was, the tree started wavering and making cracking noises.\n\nCognition Gu told Ren Zu: “Oh no, Ren Zu, you are carrying your daughter, it is impossible to get out of ordinary abyss. This is your accomplishment tree, it cannot help others become extraordinary, even your daughter is no exception.”\n\nRen Zu shook his head: “I do not want to give up.”\n\nHope Gu also urged him: “Put her down, otherwise, you cannot leave this place. Even though you have the hearts of loneliness and discontent, after planting so many trees, your heart blood is already dry. This is your last hope! Look, the tree is about to collapse!”\n\nRen Zu waved his hand: “I still want to try.”\n\nSelf Gu saw that Ren Zu was stubborn from his actions, and seeing that the other Gu worms failed to convince him, it flew out.\n\n“Ah, this is killing me!” Self Gu did not discuss with Ren Zu, it bit on Boundless Forest Samsara’s hand.\n\nBoundless Forest Samsara shouted in pain, she was furious, she wanted to kill self Gu.\n\nBut this way, she let go of her hands, with the shaking tree, she fell off Ren Zu’s back, crashing and tumbling, after breaking her fall from many branches, she landed on the ground, she was in great pain as she started crying.\n\n“Daughter!” Ren Zu shouted, wanting to go down.\n\n“It’s too late, the tree is going to fall!” Self Gu pushed Ren Zu, he took a huge step forward subconsciously, he left ordinary abyss!\n\nThe tree fell.\n\nRen Zu was at the edge of the cliff, he lost the way back, he shouted helplessly: “Daughter, I will return to save you.”\n\nBoundless Forest Samsara cried, she said with much sadness and helplessness: “Father, how could you be so cruel to leave me behind to live here alone, I am so scared!”\n\nRen Zu heard her cries and felt extremely anguished, he checked around ordinary abyss, but could not find a way in.\n\n“It is no use.” Self Gu said: “Your accomplishment tree, even if it has fallen, is proof of your grandeur. A grand person is extraordinary, how can a person who is not ordinary enter ordinary abyss?”\n\n…\n\nHu Immortal blessed land, Dang Hun palace.\n\nFang Yuan closed > in his hands, he sighed as he had a complex expression.\n\nWater flowed downwards, while humans moved towards higher ground. Discontented with being ordinary, this was a normal human trait. Dong Fang Chang Fan was like this, Fang Yuan was also like this.\n\n“In this aspect, you and I are the same type of people.” Fang Yuan said plainly.\n\nIn front of him, Dong Fang Chang Fan’s soul was restrained, he was smiling coldly now as he tried to speak — but because he lost his body, he could not make a sound. However, the resonance caused by his soul was captured by Fang Yuan.\n\nHe heard the number one wisdom path Gu Immortal in Northern Plains say: “If you want to search my soul, go ahead! But to receive my inheritance, hehe, it is harder than you think.”"
