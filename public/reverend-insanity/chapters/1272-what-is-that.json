  "content": "After the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain ended, Fang Yuan had tested this body’s limits.\n\nHe did not use any Gu worms, but he was fast like a charging horse.\n\nBy just leaping gently, he could jump ten meters of distance.\n\nJumping down from a hundred and eighty meters while pointing his head downwards, he felt a little dizzy but it only lasted for three breaths of time, and was gone before he knew it.\n\nHe had great strength and endurance as well, he ran for minutes without feeling any fatigue at all.\n\nHis five senses and visual acuity were beyond amazing! His vision was outstanding, looking ten thousand steps ahead, everything was clear to him.\n\nHis heartbeat returned to normal after exercising intensely, every time it beat, it was very strong and lively.\n\nHis thinking speed was extremely fast as well. Even if it was under the light of wisdom, he could maintain it for a long time. Even Gu Immortals could rarely reach this extent with only their bodies.\n\nNot just a metal tree, even if a metal hill crashed at him, Fang Yuan would be intact.\n\nThis was the sovereign immortal body’s own physique, it had nothing to do with Gu worms, it had to do with his dao marks.\n\n“Inside Reverse Flow River, I cannot use Gu worms, but the same goes for others!”\n\n“Meanwhile, my sovereign immortal body is sufficiently strong, my dao marks are also high in quantity.”\n\nFang Yuan thought about it, his mood turned into excitement.\n\n“Ying Wu Xie!”\n\nHe flung his limbs as he swam forward like a swordfish.\n\nThe whole Reverse Flow River was running quickly, but the overall flow was affected by the formation, it flowed towards Black Extremity and Flood Extremity.\n\nRoar!\n\nA striped tiger was climbing onto a plank with its limbs.\n\nFang Yuan swam to the tiger but it was unmoved. Meanwhile, Fang Yuan panted as he took a little rest on the plank.\n\nBut this plank could not endure the weight of both the human and tiger, it started sinking.\n\nThe tiger was anxious, it bore its fangs at Fang Yuan and wanted to bite him, but Fang Yuan snorted and stretched out his arm, crushing the tiger’s head as he raised his fist and punched this tiger to death.\n\n“Thankfully, this is not a desolate beast but an ordinary beast instead.”\n\nAgainst a desolate beast, the sovereign immortal body was not enough.\n\nSnowy Mountain blessed land did not lack desolate beasts. But to refine fortune rivalling heaven Immortal Gu, in activating the formation and defending against enemies, Snowy Mountain blessed land had already been modified. Gu Immortals with desolate beasts had kept them in their immortal apertures, they would not allow enemies to kill the desolate beasts, that would just be stupid.\n\nFang Yuan swam in Reverse Flow River, he wanted to find Ying Wu Xie.\n\nSnowy Mountain blessed land collapsed, Reverse Flow River was pouring out, Fang Yuan did not know that Purple Mountain True Monarch had awakened.\n\nHe was still thinking of Old Ancestor Xue Hu as the main enemy. He estimated that Ying Wu Xie had some relationship with Snowy Mountain, but it was not close. Otherwise, why would Old Ancestor Xue Hu not help during the Battle of Yi Tian Mountain?\n\nFang Yuan’s analysis was not wrong.\n\nBut his information path methods were too lacking, he did not have enough intel.\n\n“Right now, even if I meet Old Ancestor Xue Hu, I can survive. Because in Reverse Flow River, Gu worms cannot be used, it is a special environment!”\n\n“Since Ying Wu Xie has some connection with Old Ancestor Xue Hu, if I miss this chance, they will definitely grow rapidly under his protection.”\n\n“If I miss this chance, I might not have another opportunity to eliminate them again!”\n\nThinking of this, Fang Yuan moved ahead after resting shortly.\n\nBut he met Bi Chen Tian.\n\nA Central Continent rank eight Gu Immortal!\n\nFang Yuan was shocked.\n\n“What is going on?”\n\n“A rank eight Gu Immortal who isn’t Old Ancestor Xue Hu, and is from Central Continent?!”\n\nBi Chen Tian was in a terrible state, he was covered in injuries as he rested on a huge turtle’s back.\n\nThese injuries were not from Reverse Flow River’s journey, but were sustained in the battle earlier. He was a rank eight Gu Immortal, his dao marks conflicted and it was harder to heal from injuries once he sustained them.\n\nBut in that battle, he was in a weaker position, how could he have time to heal himself?\n\nThus, after the main formation collapsed, he was swept by Reverse Flow River and could not use his Gu worms to heal himself, all the way until now.\n\nBut fortunately, while being washed away in the river, he met a floating turtle and managed to get a chance to rest on it.\n\nFang Yuan discovered Bi Chen Tian, Bi Chen Tian also saw Fang Yuan.\n\nBut Bi Chen Tian did not recognize Fang Yuan.\n\nBecause Fang Yuan was in his sovereign immortal body’s appearance! His original appearance was exposed by Heavenly Court and was spread over all five regions.\n\nEven though Bi Chen Tian did not know Fang Yuan, he frowned and became alert.\n\nBecause Fang Yuan’s aura showed that he was a Northern Plains Gu Immortal.\n\nThis was also because of the sovereign immortal body.\n\nAfter passing the regional wall, Fang Yuan could change his aura into that of the region he was in, he was a Gu Immortal of the region and could perfectly fuse into it.\n\n“Who is this? He is not one of the peak lords of Snowy Mountain blessed land, however, he could have been recruited by Old Ancestor Xue Hu secretly.”\n\nBi Chen Tian stood up on the turtle’s shell, looking at Fang Yuan’s every movement.\n\nInside Reverse Flow River, even though Bi Chen Tian had rank eight cultivation level, his Gu worms could not be used, he had limited battle strength.\n\nFang Yuan also looked at him alertly, he did not get close.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan had the sovereign immortal body, he would be stupid if he thought he was the strongest person in Reverse Flow River!\n\nReverse Flow River did not allow Gu worms to be used, but his body was intact, his dao marks were effective.\n\nFang Yuan’s sovereign immortal body was very powerful, because of the dao marks on the immortal body.\n\nSimilarly, if a Gu Master used black boar Gu to gain the strength of a boar, he would have the strength path dao marks carved into his body. If this Gu Master falls into Reverse Flow River, and is unable to use Gu worms, he would still be able to use his body and attack with the strength of a boar.\n\nAs for other Gu Immortals, over the long course of their cultivation journey, how could they not use any Gu worms like black boar Gu to increase the number of dao marks in their bodies?\n\nThis was natural!\n\nAnyone who was not a fool would know the advantages of such dao marks.\n\nFang Yuan’s body had its advantages, so did other Gu Immortals, the extent simply varied from one person to another.\n\nFor rank eight Gu Immortals, they had deep foundations, Fang Yuan did not want to fight against Bi Chen Tian at the moment.\n\n“You are a Central Continent Gu Immortal?”\n\n“I am a Northern Plains Gu Immortal, but I have a grudge with Old Ancestor Xue Hu.”\n\n“I saw him trying to refine the rank eight Immortal Gu, I did not want him to succeed, so I went to the outside of the blessed land and tried to find a way to break in.”\n\n“Are you a helper for him to refine the Gu?”\n\nFang Yuan probed.\n\nBi Chen Tian’s frown eased a little, he answered: “Old Ancestor Xue Hu is also my enemy.”\n\n“Not long ago, I was fighting against him in Snowy Mountain blessed land, but this unexpected surprise happened.”\n\n“My injuries are all caused by Old Ancestor Xue Hu.”\n\nThe two talked and exchanged information.\n\nFang Yuan realized now that so many things had happened in Snowy Mountain blessed land!\n\nBut Bi Chen Tian was very vague about many things, Fang Yuan could not get much intel.\n\nThey did not trust each other after all.\n\nThis was natural.\n\nThey only had interacted a little, it was hard to tell what the other person’s intentions were.\n\nAnd in this situation where Gu worms could not be used, both sides were at their highest alertness.\n\nFang Yuan knew he could not get more information from Bi Chen Tian and decided to leave.\n\nHe left that huge wild turtle.\n\nEven during the conversation, he did not get closer, while Bi Chen Tian did not invite Fang Yuan to rest on the turtle’s back.\n\nBi Chen Tian saw that Fang Yuan was leaving and his expression relaxed a little.\n\nBut at this moment, an unexpected surprise occurred.\n\nPing.\n\nA soft sound echoed.\n\nA fist-sized thing was washed down by the river, landing on Fang Yuan’s face.\n\nThis thing was soft and tiny, like a jellyfish, it stuck to Fang Yuan’s forehead.\n\n“What is this?” Fang Yuan was stunned, he wanted to pull it away.\n\nBut at this time, he heard Bi Chen Tian call out: “Be gentle, don’t crush it!”\n\n“Oh?” Fang Yuan was surprised, what was it that made a rank eight Gu Immortal nervous?"
