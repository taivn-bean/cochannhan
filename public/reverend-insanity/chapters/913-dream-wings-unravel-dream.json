Even if I failed this time, I can just wait for the next attempt at the dream realm, and try again.” Feng Jin Huang snorted smugly internally.\n\nShe had tried earlier, the wind knot grass in her hands had already been ruined by her, the knot was even worse than at the beginning.\n\nBut when Feng Jin Huang was about to escape by flapping her wings, an eagle bodied beastman pounced down from the sky.\n\nFeng Jin Huang shrieked in fear, she wanted to dodge.\n\nBut the wings that could flap rapidly ordinarily were extremely slow when they tried to move in this dream realm.\n\nFeng Jin Huang had underestimated Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s dream realm, it was much more hard to deal with, her soul was crushed by the eagle bodied beastman before she could escape!\n\nWith just one hit, Feng Jin Huang’s soul was heavily injured.\n\nAt the next moment, Feng Jin Huang left the dream realm, her soul returned to her body.\n\nPuff!\n\nShe opened her eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood.\n\nThe Gu Masters from Spirit Affinity House were shocked, they quickly came over to assist her.\n\n“What a formidable dream realm! If I were to take another hit like that one earlier, I would definitely die inside the dream for real.” Feng Jin Huang’s eyes were flashing with lingering fear, cold sweat was pouring down her back.\n\n“I was careless! Even though I have dream wings Immortal Gu, against the dream realm of an Immortal Venerable, I am not safe at all. Thankfully, I had prepared a large number of guts Gu and brought it with me. With guts Gu, my soul will recover rapidly. In half a day, I will heal completely.” Feng Jin Huang wiped the cold sweat off her forehead as she stopped wasting time, she quickly started healing herself.\n\nIn the dream realm, Fang Yuan directed his gaze towards the wind knot grass again.\n\nFeng Jin Huang’s earlier performance gave Fang Yuan quite a bit of information.\n\n“This dream realm is not large in scale, this current scene is only the outer layer of the dream realm, this is an Immortal Venerable’s dream after all, even with the rank six dream wings Immortal Gu, she could not escape immediately. Now it seems, the crux of this dream realm is the wind knot grass in my hands.”\n\nFang Yuan had a realization.\n\nAfter he finished his observations, he started to untie the wind knot grass.\n\nHe first tried to untie it from the outermost layer.\n\nHe felt like he was facing a complex and tangled ball of string. He needed to find the outer tip of the string and pull it out slowly strand by strand.\n\nAt the third layer, Fang Yuan could not continue further.\n\nIt was a complete mess in front of him, the stalks were intertwined together, he could not untie it manually.\n\n“To untie the wind knot grass without using brute strength, not only would I need confidence and good perception, I need to deduce it with my brain, I also need patience and ample time most importantly, along with some luck.”\n\nFang Yuan sighed to himself inwardly.\n\nHe had opened a path in this wind knot grass, but this path was stuck at the third layer.\n\nThere was a way out for him now, that was to retreat by two layers and try to untie this from another end.\n\nOther people could only do this as well.\n\nBut there was an exception.\n\nFang Yuan looked around and noticed that the girl he suspected was Star Constellation Immortal Venerable had already untied the seventh layer.\n\nThe wind knot grass had shrunken in half in her hands.\n\n“Without using any wisdom path Gu worms, using purely her brain power, she reached this stage?” Fang Yuan was shocked.\n\nEven though he had been late at starting to unite the wind knot grass, the difference between them was still too great.\n\nFang Yuan squinted, he concealed the brilliance shining in his eyes.\n\nIn terms of untying ability, Fang Yuan was only at the middle to upper tier among the children.\n\nIn terms of progress, he was at the middle to lower tier.\n\nMore than half the time had passed already.\n\nLooking at the speed of the children, the only one with any hopes of escaping was the girl who he thought was Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nBut Fang Yuan had ample confidence, he believed that not only could he succeed, he would even surpass everyone and become the first.\n\nWhat gave him confidence was none other than the dream path immortal killer move — Unravel Dream!\n\nUnravel dream activated.\n\nThe intertwined strands in front of him slowly melted, they untied themselves.\n\nThe surrounding beastmen were watching this, especially a snake beastman behind Fang Yuan, it was observing the entire process.\n\nBut they did not say anything, or take any action.\n\nThis was the mystical power of unravel dream.\n\nIt was not an offensive killer move purely, its effect varied according to the dream he was in.\n\nFor example, if Fang Yuan was fighting inside a dream realm, unravel dream would be his strongest attacking method. If the dream realm was weak, he could directly disintegrate his enemies.\n\nRight now, the dream realm’s rules were for Fang Yuan to untie the wind knot grass. Then, unravel dream’s current effect was to help Fang Yuan and untie the wind knot grass.\n\nThis untying was according to the set rules, it was not unraveled through brute force.\n\nIn the eyes of the surrounding children and the observing beastmen, Fang Yuan was not cheating at all, he was using his brain and successfully untying the third layer of the wind knot grass.\n\nThus, they did not do anything, even the snake person that wanted to eat Fang Yuan only watched with a slightly surprised expression, it felt that it was somewhat unexpected that Fang Yuan could untie three layers.\n\nUnravel dream.\n\nUnravel dream.\n\nUnravel dream.\n\nFang Yuan continued his momentum and did not stop. The wind knot grass in his hands was quickly untied, he reached the center.\n\nAt the core of the wind knot grass, there was a seed.\n\nThis was the self-defense mechanism of the plants in immemorial green heaven, as well as a way to use the wind for dispersal.\n\nFang Yuan took out the seed, standing up and raising it high.\n\n“He, he succeeded!”\n\n“This speed is too fast!!”\n\n“I am begging you, help me, okay?”\n\nThe surrounding people were stirred up, even the girl who he suspected to be Star Constellation Immortal Venerable gave him a surprised gaze.\n\n“You are free, little thing, I will give you three days to escape for your life, scram now.” The leader of the beastman tribe snorted, kicking Fang Yuan and sending him flying.\n\nFang Yuan’s tiny body flew in the air for a distance of more than ten steps before crashing on the ground.\n\nWhat made Fang Yuan surprised was, even though he felt a little short of breath from getting kicked, he was uninjured.\n\nThe beastman leader was strong and powerful, but in terms of physical movements, it had reached the stage of perfect self control.\n\nSince Fang Yuan had untied the wind knot grass, the beastman tribe had to let him go.\n\nFang Yuan gaze a glance at the little girl, the latter had already gathered her attention to the wind knot grass in her hands.\n\nFang Yuan hesitated slightly, before turning around and leaving.\n\nHe left the bonfire, walking towards the darkness in the forest.\n\nHe only took a dozen steps before there was a bright light shining in the darkness.\n\nThe more he walked forward, the brighter the light, eventually, all of the darkness in front of him turned into light.\n\nThe light faded slowly, and the scene of reality showed itself in front of him.\n\nFang Yuan realized that not only did he open his eyes, his body had walked for over a dozen steps, away from the manifested dream realm.\n\nLooking back at the dream realm, Fang Yuan frowned deeply, he was very confused: “What is going on? I left the dream realm just like that?”\n\nHe thought it over.\n\nThis exploration of the dream realm did not fail.\n\nHis wisdom path attainment level had risen slightly.\n\n“This should not be! According to the scale of this dream realm, there should be three scenes. I got through the first round, why did I not enter the second round successfully?”\n\nFang Yuan stood on the spot as he pondered.\n\nThe light emitted by the manifested dream realm shined on his face.\n\nHe left the dream realm and returned on the same route from which he entered. On the other side of the dream realm, Spirit Affinity House’s group was still trying to heal Feng Jin Huang urgently.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan was not exposed.\n\nBut if he could not understand why he left the dream realm, there was a possibility that he might walk towards Spirit Affinity House’s direction the next time he left it.\n\nIf others found out that Fang Yuan could explore the dream realm, it would be somewhat troublesome.\n\nAfter a long time, Fang Yuan’s tight frown gradually eased.\n\nHe walked forwards and let the dream realm engulf him.\n\nHis vision changed, Fang Yuan had entered Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s dream realm again.\n\nDark night, bonfire, beastmen, children, wind knot grass, the same scene was unfolding again.\n\nUsing unravel dream, Fang Yuan cheated all the way, becoming the first to untie the wind knot grass.\n\nBut this time, he did not leave, he walked towards the girl who he thought was Star Constellation Immortal Venerable and tried to help her untie her wind knot grass.\n\nThe beastman leader did not object, he said: “Little rascal, you still want to help others? Hehe, you can help her, but if you fail, you will lose your life!”\n\n“It seems my guess is correct.” Fang Yuan was overjoyed, he untied the wind knot grass within the time limit and successfully escaped with the girl.\n\n“What? I still left?” Fang Yuan looked back in surprise.\n\nHis second attempt still failed. Fang Yuan did not enter the second scene, he was thrown out of the dream realm like the first time.\n\nDream realms were unpredictable and strange, their rules varied. Because each dream realm was unique, it was hard to accumulate experience in exploring the dream realm. Even though Fang Yuan had his previous life’s memories, his advantage was still very small.\n\n“This time, after saving the girl, my wisdom path attainment went up more than last time…” Fang Yuan muttered.\n\nHe went into deep contemplation.\n\nAccording to this situation, there were two possibilities.\n\nOne, the girl that he saved was not the real Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nTwo, he had to save more children, after he hit a certain number, he would enter the second scene.\n\nBefore he entered the dream realm for a third time, Fang Yuan rested slightly first.\n\nHe took out guts Gu and healed his weakened soul back to its prime.\n\nEven though he had successfully escaped the dream realm and did a successful exploration, his soul was not unharmed, he still expended a lot of it in the dream realm.\n\nOf course, Fang Yuan’s soul was far less injured than Feng Jin Huang’s.\n\nThe former had succeeded, while the latter’s exploration failed, this was incomparable.\n\n“Third time!” Fang Yuan spurring himself on inwardly, he entered the dream realm again.\n\nEverything restarted again in the dream.\n\nThe moment the wind knot grass was distributed, Fang Yuan used the killer move unravel dream several times and in a few breaths’ time, he untied the wind knot grass in his hand.\n\nFang Yuan grabbed onto the seed as he raised up his right hand, shouting: “I succeeded!”\n\nAt once, be it the beastmen or children, they stared with wide open eyes as they looked at Fang Yuan in shock.\n\nThe noisy scene turned into creepy silence."
