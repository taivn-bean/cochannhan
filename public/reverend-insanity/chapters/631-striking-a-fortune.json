  "content": "Chapter 631: Striking a fortune\n\nThe six fingered formless hand’s appearance was so sudden that Fang Yuan only had the time to raise his head.\n\nThe light blue radiance shone down on his face as his sight was filled with the giant light blue hand.\n\nThe formless hand did not show any notions of stopping, grabbing towards Fang Yuan, completely shrouding over his body.\n\n“Junior brother!” Tai Bai Yun Sheng shouted in fright.\n\nThe next moment, however, this six fingered formless fist loosened up and spread open.\n\nFang Yuan’s figure showed up five hundred steps away. The six fingered formless hand had grabbed at nothing.\n\nFlash bug Gu!\n\nThis Gu was a rare rank five space path movement Gu. Fang Yuan had to spend a lot of efforts to purchase it in treasure yellow heaven.\n\n“Hufff…” Tai Bai Yun Sheng let out a breath of turbid air, a giant stone lifted off his heart.\n\nTai Bai Yun Sheng knew Fang Yuan was unable to react properly because he had just came out. In truth, it was nothing difficult for flying masters to evade these formless hands.\n\n“Close call!” Fang Yuan’s body let out cold sweat from the fright.\n\nHe had much more understanding of formless hands than others; as such, he knew their threat level clearly!\n\n“Formless hand is Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable’s killer move; it can range from one finger to nine fingers, respectively able to seize rank one to rank nine Gu worms! They can even seize the vital Gu without any problems. If that six fingered formless hand succeeded in grabbing me, I would have definitely lost either Spring Autumn Cicada or Fixed Immortal Travel… my luck is too bad, it actually provoked such a catastrophe!”\n\nFang Yuan rapidly flew, dodging the pursuit of the formless hand while observing his surroundings.\n\nTrue inheritance secluded domain had already fallen into complete chaos.\n\nTrue inheritance meteors and formless hands filled one’s sight; Gu Masters flew around in disorder – some were evading the formless hands, some cried out in grief after their Gu worms were seized, while some used all their strength to attack the formless hands.\n\n“It seems that they have found out already! Once a formless hand captures a Gu worm, it will clench its fist; this is the moment it can be attacked! When it is in its spread out palm form, it is almost completely immune to all attacks and can only be dodged.”\n\nFang Yuan recalled the relevant information on formless hands.\n\nHe was very familiar with the formless hands. In his previous life, Ma Hong Yun had successively obtained a portion of Giant Sun Immortal Venerable and Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable’s inheritance, also obtaining a similar method of capturing Gu worms. He had used this method many times in the great battle of the five regions, resulting in the disastrous loss of many strong enemies and making them flee.\n\nFang Yuan had thus researched a lot on this.\n\nFang Yuan continued to dodge, use flash bug Gu, wind flower Gu, eagle rise Gu and so on before he was able to pull apart a huge distance, making the six fingered formless hand chasing him to change its target.\n\nHe immediately sent a portion of his consciousness to inspect his immortal aperture.\n\nThere were remnants of heaven and earth qi in true inheritance secluded domain.\n\nEver since Fang Yuan came out, his immortal aperture had been crazily absorbing these heaven and earth qi, growing rapidly.\n\nIn just a short while, his immortal aperture had expanded to over 2000km2 and was still growing.\n\nAt the same time, the time flow inside the immortal aperture was starting to become faster than the outside world. From a one to one ratio, it increased to six times as fast.\n\n“Damn it.” Fang Yuan suddenly frowned and his face paled.\n\nThe change in the immortal aperture was going smoothly, but the problem appeared in the first aperture; more accurately, the problem was the Spring Autumn Cicada.\n\nSpring Autumn Cicada was recovering rapidly and the first aperture was already showing signs of being unable to bear the huge pressure from it!\n\n“Oh no! When an immortal aperture is born, not only does the space enlarge, the time flow also changes. The change in the time flow is the main reason an immortal aperture can turn into a small world and attract a tributary of the river of time! Spring Autumn Cicada feeds on the water of the river of time, and now being so close to the source, it is able to drink a lot and accelerate its recovery speed!”\n\nFang Yuan was able to instantly understand what was going on.\n\nSince the last activation of Spring Autumn Cicada which had fortunately succeeded, it had been slowly recovering.\n\nIt has been a long time since Fang Yuan arrived in northern plains; Spring Autumn Cicada was gradually recovering causing the pressure on the first aperture to increase day by day.\n\nThe first aperture was already at rank five peak stage and should have been able to endure for some time according to Fang Yuan’s estimation. But this unforeseen event had greatly shifted the time limit to an earlier date!\n\nSince rebirth, Spring Autumn Cicada had been a hidden danger to Fang Yuan. Now that Fang Yuan was advancing to a Gu Immortal, this hidden danger had expanded to a serious danger that directly pushed itself to Fang Yuan’s sight.\n\n“Damn it.” Fang Yuan gritted his teeth. He suddenly descended; a formless hand passed by his hair, grabbing at the air.\n\nFor now, Fang Yuan had no way to deal with this situation.\n\nThe immortal aperture must be successfully created, otherwise all his efforts would go to waste. Without a Gu Immortal’s strength, it would be impossible for him to continue contending.\n\nHowever, Spring Autumn Cicada also could not be ignored.\n\nCrack…\n\nA huge sound echoed in true inheritance secluded domain like some important thing had shattered, causing palpitation in everyone’s heart.\n\nEveryone paused and hurriedly looked up.\n\nLike an egg shell that was smashed, countless cracks appeared on true inheritance secluded domain. The cracks rapidly enlarged and let the outside world’s light flow in.\n\nAt the same time, many formless hands also squeezed in through the cracks, a seven fingered formless hand among them!\n\nThe Gu Masters let out shocked cries at the sight of so many giant light blue hands.\n\n“Why are there so many giant hands?”\n\n“This is bad, look, a seven fingered giant hand has actually squeezed in!”\n\nWith the endless giant light blue hands flying in true inheritance secluded domain, everyone’s situation had become even more perilous.\n\nHei Lou Lan’s expression was grave and even Tai Bai Yun Sheng felt an intense suffocation.\n\nFlying masters were not omnipotent.\n\nWith so many formless hands, the difficult in evading them increased greatly.\n\nMoreover, the longer they spent, the more likely it was for them to make an error under such a strained state.\n\n“This is turning worse!” Tai Bai Yun Sheng was gloomy, what he was afraid of came, he made a mistake in the crucial time.\n\nHis sole remaining escape path was blocked by six formless hands.\n\nAt this moment of crisis, Tai Bai Yun Sheng gritted his teeth and directly crashed towards a three fingered formless hand.\n\nThe formless hand grabbed him; Tai Bai Yun Sheng was immediately paralyzed.\n\nBut this time period was extremely short and soon, the three fingered formless hand flew away with a clenched fist. Out of danger, Tai Bai Yun Sheng immediately burst out with his greatest speed and escaped through this gap.\n\nTai Bai Yun Sheng’s back was soaked with cold sweat from this thrilling situation.\n\nEven Tai Bai Yun Sheng was in such a predicament, let alone others.\n\nAll the Gu Masters met with calamity, at worst, not even one of their Gu worms remained.\n\nWithout Gu worms, Gu Master’s battle strength plunged down to the very bottom. And even if they had a lot of primeval essence, it would be of no use.\n\n“Save me!” A Gu Master looked on with fright a true inheritance that was flying right towards him.\n\nAll his Gu worms were already seized by the formless hands. At this moment of life and death, he cried out for help while swinging his arms crazily to speed up his flight, but his movement speed was no faster than a snail in comparison to the true inheritance.\n\nThe surrounding Gu Masters heard his plea for help, but right now they had no way to help however much they wanted to.\n\nThud!\n\nThere was no unexpected event; the unlucky Gu Master was directly crushed into meat paste by the true inheritance.\n\nThis blue colored true inheritance did not stop after crushing the Gu Master and kept on flying away.\n\nOn its way, formless hands kept on obstructing its path while it kept on evading.\n\nThe wild newborn Gu will in the true inheritance also sensed the deadly threat of the heavenly tribulation formless hands, and did its best to escape.\n\nHowever, the will of Gu worms was not as intelligent as humans.\n\nThe blue colored true inheritance evaded several formless hands before it was finally grabbed by a five fingered formless hand.\n\nThe formless hand clenched its fist tightly but did not stop at the place.\n\nThe true inheritance light lump’s speed was too fast; the formless hand was pulled in its inertia, except that the speed was greatly reduced.\n\nThe five fingered formless hand flew away with a Gu worm. But even more formless hands pounced down and covered the true inheritance light lump.\n\nOne hand was not enough, another came followed by the next. Soon, ten formless hands were tightly grabbing the true inheritance light lump.\n\nThe true inheritance light lump continued to slow until it came to a stop.\n\nThe formless hands suddenly separated and flew in all directions with clenched fists.\n\nThere was nothing left at the spot, the blue colored true inheritance was already robbed clean.\n\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan snickered and flew towards the target he had his eyes on, and started attacking fiercely.\n\nA formless fist was broken by his attacks and revealed the Gu it was holding.\n\nFang Yuan immediately reacted and grabbed it.\n\nThis was a rank five mortal Gu and after he refined it, he stored it in his pocket.\n\nFlash bug Gu!\n\nHe disappeared from the spot and suddenly appeared three hundred steps away, right beside another formless fist.\n\nBam bam bam.\n\nHe punched heavily and broke the formless fist in three punches, leaving after grabbing the Gu.\n\nIt was an Immortal Gu!\n\nAlmost at the very next moment, a formless hand pounced at him, and naturally it was in vain.\n\nFang Yuan moved like lightning, occasionally soaring like a sparrow and occasionally piercing forward like an eagle.\n\nHe was dodging the formless hands while also taking any chance to strike a fortune, grabbing many Gu worms of the true inheritance.\n\nHowever, the formless fists were very fast and the opportunity to destroy them was fleeting.\n\nThe blue colored true inheritance was a good opportunity Fang Yuan ran into, but he only had enough time to break three formless fists, obtaining two mortal Gu and an Immortal Gu.\n\nWhile Fang Yuan was occupied with breaking the formless fist, the other formless fists had already flown far away and Fang Yuan was not able to chase after them.\n\n“Suppress!”\n\nFang Yuan transferred his will into the Gu worms to temporarily suppress them.\n\nHe did not have the time to refine these Gu worms, let alone study their uses.\n\nSuddenly, Fang Yuan’s sight was covered with blue light.\n\nMaybe it was because Fang Yuan was too active and attention drawing, eight formless hands attacked him together!\n\nFang Yuan’s heart jumped and he quickly evaded.\n\nHe moved and stopped at times, changing his directions madly; his vision kept on changing intensely, one moment he was above while the next he was below. He almost made himself go dizzy.\n\nHe spent tremendous effort before he was able to get rid of the formless hands.\n\nHe had just stabilized his breathing when suddenly, there was the sound of wind!\n\nA formless hand was flying right towards him.\n\nFang Yuan was just about to dodge, but his pupils enlarged rapidly the next moment. This was a formless fist!\n\nHe laughed heartily and flapped his six wings, directly punching towards the formless fist. He obtained a rank five Gu after breaking the formless fist.\n\nThe Gu worm was vibrating in his hand and struggled intensely, attempting to escape.\n\nFang Yuan sent a portion of his will inside, but was not able to suppress it.\n\nHe immediately frowned as he realized this Gu was not a wild Gu, but a Gu Master’s Gu worm. Because the Gu worm had someone else’s will, the difficulty in refining it was several times greater than refining wild Gu, and even temporarily suppressing it was difficult!\n\n“Let go of my Gu!” A familiar voice sounded by Fang Yuan’s ears at this moment.\n\nFang Yuan looked at the source of the voice, and immediately smiled.\n\nHe saw Hei Lou Lan flying towards him hurriedly and furiously, his gaze fixed on the Gu in Fang Yuan’s hand.\n\nChibiGeneral Yoink, this is mine now."
