  "content": "**Chapter 2194: Unification of Three Worlds**\n\nImmortal killer move — Golden Top Ox Hair!\n\nThe drizzle of dazzling golden light increased rapidly, it quickly spread and covered the dozens of giant arms.\n\nGolden light rained down endlessly, penetrating into the pitch-black giant arms.\n\nThe giant arms shook, golden flowing veins appeared and moved up the arms while interweaving into an exquisite web.\n\nWhen the golden web covered over half of the giant arms, the giant arms started shaking extremely fiercely.\n\nThe pressure on Fang Yuan reduced sharply, the giant arms could not even budge under the infiltration of the golden web.\n\nThis golden top ox hair killer move clearly also had the ability to confine its enemies. But it was different from Fang Yuan’s ten li time wind, it infiltrated the target’s body and controlled their movement.\n\nWhen the golden web covered the giant arms completely, these dozens of giant arms came under Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s control. They moved up and attacked Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s main body!\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable was furious, at that instant, a thousand or so giant arms came down, destroying these dozens of traitorous arms.\n\nThe golden web lost its attached targets, turning back into a drizzle of golden light.\n\nAmidst the golden light drizzle, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun’s figure appeared slowly.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable gave a shout, his thunder-like voice shook the whole Door of Life and Death.\n\nA grey tornado immediately formed and moved towards Fang Yuan’s group.\n\nThe grey tornado did not have absorption force, instead it had a huge repulsive force. Wind blades that were sharper than Luo Po wind rotated and cut the souls.\n\nImmortal Zombie Giant Sun, Fang Yuan, and the immortals quickly retreated. Soul beasts rushed over from afar, but were dismembered by the wind blades.\n\nAfter these soul beasts died, they were absorbed by the grey tornado, changing into grey soul bombs.\n\nA soul bomb struck and exploded on Lu Wei Yin. Lu Wei Yin’s soul was immediately injured heavily, he almost fainted.\n\nHe had exceptional defense but faced this situation. Other immortals like Qi Jue and Shen Shang were even more miserable, their souls might have been swept away if not for Fang Yuan’s help.\n\nThe number of soul path dao marks in the Door of Life and Death was unimaginable.\n\nBefore Spectral Soul Demon Venerable awakened, these pseudo venerables could only use fifty percent of their strength because of the dao mark suppression.\n\nNow that he awakened, pseudo venerables could only use twenty percent of their strength. Even Fang Yuan and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun could only use fifty percent of their strength!\n\n“What’s going on? Spectral Soul is also a supreme grandmaster.”\n\n“Although Spectral Soul Demon Venerable lost his physical body, he has already modified himself into gaining a soul beast body!”\n\n“He has almost merged with the Door of Life and Death. With this environment, all his killer moves are amplified greatly, he can easily suppress us. This is the power of a Dao Lord!”\n\n“What now?”\n\nThe immortals could not help but hesitate.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable’s battle strength far surpassed the expectations of many of them.\n\nAnother crucial point was that the Door of Life and Death had too many soul path dao marks.\n\nWhen fate Gu was intact, the soul of every dead being returned to the Door of Life and Death. Even when fate Gu was damaged, most of the dead beings’ souls still returned here.\n\nCountless years accumulated, countless souls gathered and broke down to form the current Door of Life and Death.\n\nAmong all the secluded domains of heaven and earth, the Door of Life and Death was likely to have the highest number of dao marks!\n\nAt the crucial moment, Fang Yuan and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun collaborated to destroy the grey tornado and detonate the thousands of grey soul bombs.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable bent over slightly, thousands of giant arms attacked from all sides. It was like the sky was falling, creating a suffocating feeling!\n\nFang Yuan and Immortal Zombie Giant Sun began to use all their strength.\n\nThe giant arms were destroyed one after the other. Their fragments fell to the ground, immediately changing into soul beasts that charged forward to fight once again.\n\nLu Wei Yin and the other pseudo venerables were in charge of killing these soul beasts.\n\nAfter the soul beasts died, their fragments combined to form new soul beasts.\n\nMoreover, these newly born soul beasts were stronger than the previous soul beasts. They possessed talents and abilities, thus they could counter Lu Wei Yin and the other Gu Immortals.\n\nFang Yuan, Immortal Zombie Giant Sun, and other Gu Immortals were at a disadvantage.\n\nThey were struggling to cope with the countless soul beasts and endless giant arms that attacked unceasingly.\n\nRight now, soul path fully displayed its combat advantage by fueling itself through killing!\n\n“Die! All of you, die!!” Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s mind became even more chaotic, roaring like a wild beast.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable smiled, her clear voice was not suppressed by the chaotic battlefield, instead it reached the immortals’ ears: “Everyone, your valiance really makes me feel admiration. Fang Yuan, Giant Sun, I’ll take a quick leave first.”\n\nSaying this, she leisurely retreated. Her body streaked across the dark world like a meteor, easily leaving the Door of Life and Death.\n\nSince the battle began, she had been standing on Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s head, even though she was openly leaving now, she did not attract Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s attention.\n\nThis situation was frightening to see.\n\nThe grand Spectral Soul Demon Venerable actually became Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s puppet!\n\nLu Wei Yin suddenly shouted, his face was pale: “Oh no, Lord Fang Yuan! Star Constellation will definitely unite the three great worlds and destroy Paradise Earth’s tomb. We must quickly go and stop her!”\n\nHowever, this was easier said than done.\n\nSpectral Soul’s main body was a genuine Dao Lord inside the Door of Life and Death!\n\nA soul path supreme grandmaster.\n\nA complete rank nine venerable!\n\nOn the contrary, Fang Yuan was only at rank eight, and though Immortal Zombie Giant Sun was also a Dao Lord, how could he use the outside world’s luck path dao marks to amplify himself in the Door of Life and Death?\n\nHeaven and earth travel?\n\nFang Yuan had already tried it secretly, but it had no effect.\n\nHeavenly Court knew Fang Yuan had fixed immortal travel Immortal Gu, how could they not have prepared for it?\n\nNo killer move was invincible. Just like Fang Yuan’s ghostly concealment killer move, it showed no effect inside the Door of Life and Death!\n\nThe three great worlds were rapidly melting.\n\nThe boundaries had already shrunk by thirty percent.\n\nAs for the void in the eighth layer, it was originally vast and infinite, but the boundary was now sticking close to the bubbles of the three great worlds.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable returned here and immediately set up a formation.\n\nThe formation activated, Heavenly Court’s Gu Immortals split and invaded Savage Wilderness Great World and Yellow Earth Great World.\n\nThese two great worlds’ main forces had almost all died in battle. Only a few remained, they were the old and weak Gu Immortals with no battle strength left, or elite Gu Masters.\n\nBe they the former or latter, they had no ability to block Heavenly Court’s advancement.\n\nHeavenly Court continued to push in, setting a sub-formation after occupying each territory.\n\nThese sub-formations resonated with the main formation which was personally controlled by Star Constellation Immortal Venerable. The sub-formations let out grand lights that shot towards the sky and shone on the surroundings, making the vast and desolate Savage Wilderness Great World, and the hilly Yellow Earth Great World bloom with green.\n\nWeeds and tree saplings grew at a visible speed, quickly forming a dense forest.\n\nThis was only the visible phenomenon, the true essence lied in Green Lotus Great World expanding continuously as it absorbed the other two great worlds into its territory!\n\nIf looked from above, the green color that was like moss spread from the Green Lotus Great World and slowly covered the other two great worlds.\n\nAfter covering them, the lush green became even deeper in color.\n\nAt first, it was only light green, many areas with the sub-formations turned into deep green. The deep green then turned into dark green.\n\nThe three great worlds finally merged!\n\nAfter reaching a certain extent, a storm started brewing indescribably.\n\nThe storm was not large, but its range was astonishing, covering the whole world.\n\nWind blew like the qi tides of five regions, it quickly merged the primeval energy of the great world and distributed it evenly.\n\n“Limitless Demon Venerable’s heaven and earth refinement method has already reached the peak. If I am not wrong, this wind will continue to grow until it becomes the winds of assimilation!”\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable controlled the main formation, she personally took part and helped the great worlds unite, so she gained many insight from this.\n\nIn fact, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable accounted for almost half of the heaven path research results in the Crazed Demon formation!\n\nWhy did Limitless Demon Venerable go to Heavenly Court in his later years and play this game with Star Constellation Immortal Venerable?\n\nThe reason was simple.\n\nStar Constellation Immortal Venerable had merged with heaven’s will of her own accord. The killer move human executing heaven’s work was extremely profound, while she altered heaven’s will, she was also comprehending heaven path.\n\nSo, Limitless Demon Venerable competed with Star Constellation to extract the heaven path mysteries, he also received the help of this wisdom path supreme grandmaster, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, to deduce new heaven path research results.\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable cultivated rule path, only by cooperating with the creator of wisdom path, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable, could he realize the insane concept of Crazed Demon Cave!\n\nLimitless Demon Venerable achieved his goal, while Star Constellation Immortal Venerable also gained many benefits.\n\nThe three avatar fairies’ method of influencing the emotions of many mutant Gu Immortals and making them join Heavenly Court was a result of heaven path.\n\nBeing able to control Spectral Soul Demon Venerable was also an embodiment of heaven path research results. Naturally, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable took advantage of this situation. Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s main body already had flaws.\n\n“The three worlds have merged, the outcome has been decided.” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable let out a breath of air, her eyes shining with starlight.\n\nShe had succeeded.\n\nFang Yuan and Longevity Heaven’s alliance was very powerful. But she relied on her incomparable wisdom path attainment to take a lead step by step, maintaining her advantage and not letting the other two sides surpass her.\n\nAlthough Heavenly Court was weak, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable used Book Mountain, Primordial Domain, the Crazed Demon formation, and the Door of Life and Death, she used everything that could be used to help claim victory.\n\nThis was Star Constellation Immortal Venerable.\n\nThis was the power of wisdom path!\n\nHeavenly Court had already infiltrated the Crazed Demon formation, now that they united the three worlds and got hold of massive clues and fuel, it was like letting half of the Crazed Demon formation falling into Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s hands.\n\n“It is your turn now, Paradise Earth.” Star Constellation Immortal Venerable’s eyes shone coldly.\n\nShe did not like Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable.\n\nEven though Paradise Earth had the name of Immortal Venerable and had extremely high reputation, he loved and defended variant humans. Paradise Earth left Merman Imperial Court in Eastern Sea and also Mushroomman Paradise in Southern Border.\n\nWhat repulsed Star Constellation Immortal Venerable even more was Paradise Earth Immortal Venerable’s identity.\n\nParadise Earth had gone through many fortuitous encounters in his life that could have allowed him to change his fundamental identity to that of a pure human. But he did not do so, he was always a mixed blood which could never be accepted by Heavenly Court.\n\nImmediately, sub-formations buzzed and tore the earth.\n\nGround crumbled, deep ravines spread quickly from all sides to Paradise Earth’s tomb.\n\nParadise Earth’s tomb was broken apart.\n\nAfterwards, Star Constellation Immortal Venerable gave a cry, her gaze looking at the distant sky.\n\nSoon, endless starlight condensed and solidified in the sky, turning into meteors that fell to the ground.\n\nLike a rainstorm, the meteors smashed onto Paradise Earth’s tomb.\n\nBam bam bam…\n\nThe explosions rang, starlight and rock fragments flew everywhere.\n\nAfter a few minutes of time, Paradise Earth’s tomb was leveled and turned into ruins."
