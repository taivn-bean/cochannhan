Don’t mess around, my patience is running out. You also know that my sect has wisdom path Gu Immortals, with the information I already have, I can deduce the final steps. Except that I will need to spend a lot of time, effort, and funds, that is all.”\n\nDong Fang Chang Fan was quiet for a moment, he did not dare to anger Old Lord Can Yang, otherwise, he might turn on him, he had to give him the possession method.\n\nOld Lord Can Yang got what he wanted, but he did not go back on his words, he went back to the huge battle and blocked Unfettered Scholar, Lu Qing Ming and Peacock Flying Immortal He Ruo.\n\nMeanwhile, the other demonic path immortals chased Dong Fang Chang Fan relentlessly.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ping stopped.\n\n“I am unresigned! I have two immortal level movement killer moves, but at this crucial time, my immortal essence is not enough!!” He screamed, he felt deeply regretful, he could only watch as the immortals flew away.\n\nA while later, Divine Lord Tian Du also started to slow down, he sighed: “Everyone, please fight valiantly, I am unable to go any further.”\n\nIf they did not kill Dong Fang Chang Fan, there would be huge problems later.\n\nDivine Lord Tian Du landed while deeply frowning.\n\n“Brother Fang, I am not in a good position. Thank you for saving me even though your life was in danger, at this point, you should leave quickly, I will draw them away!” A while later, Dong Fang Chang Fan showed an exhausted expression as he secretly transmitted to the miniman Gu Immortal.\n\nThe miniman Gu Immortal was overjoyed, but he hesitated: “Are you really letting me go? But our agreement is not over yet…”\n\nDong Fang Chang Fan interrupted him, throwing Miniscule Mountain out as he said: “Brother Fang, say no more, all the best!”\n\n“Miniscule Mountain!!” Fairy Li Shan immediately changed her direction and tried to grab at Miniscule Mountain.\n\nMiniscule Mountain shook, turning into a jade light as it flew towards the left.\n\nAt the same time, Dong Fang Chang Fan’s tired expression vanished, his speed raised by thirty percent as he continued to escape.\n\nThe two split up, the demonic cultivators behind hesitated.\n\nBut Fairy Li Shan had no hesitation, she pursued Miniscule Mountain. Compared to the tough Dong Fang Chang Fan, the miniman Gu Immortal on Miniscule Mountain was weaker, and Miniscule Mountain was more beneficial to her.\n\nBefore leaving, she had sent a transmission to Fang Yuan and Hei Lou Lan for help.\n\nAfter all, it was hard for one person to catch Miniscule Mountain, if there was help, it would be far easier.\n\nHei Lou Lan did not hesitate, she immediately followed after Fairy Li Shan. But Fang Yuan rejected her outright, he did not stop chasing Dong Fang Chang Fan.\n\nThus, Fang Yuan, Pi Shui Han, and Qie Shi Min chased after Dong Fang Chang Fan, while Hei Lou Lan and Fairy Li Shan went after Miniscule Mountain.\n\nDisregarding Fairy Li Shan’s side, Dong Fang Chang Fan had successfully used Miniscule Mountain to lure two strong foes away, his speed was even faster now as he quickly widened the gap between him and his pursuers.\n\nPi Shui Han was anxious, he shouted to Qie Shi Min: “Why aren’t you taking out the captives?”\n\nQie Shi Min’s movement killer move was a chariot, it gave off the aura of Immortal Gu. He was sitting on the chariot, his expression grim. He had kept many of the Dong Fang tribe captives in his immortal aperture, his motive was to leave them for the end, to deal a fatal blow to Dong Fang Chang Fan.\n\nBut now, he had no choice but to use them in advance.\n\n“Old scoundrel Dong Fang, your tribesmen are in my hands, fight us directly, you cannot escape.” Qie Shi Min said this as he killed one Gu Master in his hand, taking out another one after that.\n\nDong Fang Chang Fan sneered and chuckled coldly, he continued to fly forward.\n\nAfter Qie Shi Min killed the thirteenth captive, he finally managed to get Dong Fang Chang Fan to make a mistake, the distance between him and Fang Yuan’s group shortened again.\n\nBut Dong Fang Chang Fan quickly suppressed the threat, after regaining control of the body, he flew again and moved ahead.\n\nThe two sides were in a deadlock, their distance shrunk at times and lengthened at other times.\n\nAlong the way, they met several Gu Immortals, they were either in the righteous path or demonic path, some obstructed them, some chased them, some left immediately and did not want to get involved in this messy situation.\n\nAn hour later, only Dong Fang Chang Fan, Fang Yuan, Pi Shui Han, and Qie Shi Min were left.\n\n“If I do not die from this, I will definitely reward all of you well!” Dong Fang Chang Fan was already quite far ahead, laughing loudly as he escaped.\n\nFang Yuan and the others had grim expressions.\n\nThese three pursuers were originally from the second wave, with their speed, they could not catch up to Dong Fang Chang Fan after he raised his speed.\n\nThe longer this dragged on, the greater Dong Fang Chang Fan’s advantage, he was gradually suppressing the internal threats in his body, even though Qie Shi Min was killing more Dong Fang tribesmen now, Dong Fang Chang Fan was losing control less often than before.\n\n“What do we do?” Pi Shui Han, Fang Yuan, and Qie Shi Min looked at each other, they saw anxiety but also anticipation in each other’s eyes.\n\n“Both of you, if you have any methods, please use them, otherwise, it will be too late.” Qie Shi Min said.\n\nFang Yuan and Pi Shui Han shook their heads.\n\nThese three were at their wits end already, they had to treasure their precious immortal essence beads. If they had any methods left, they would have used it already.\n\nSeeing that Dong Fang Chang Fan was going to get away from them, the three pursuers showed intense looks of disappointment.\n\nBut at this moment, Dong Fang Chang Fan lost control again, Dong Fang Yu Liang’s voice was screaming, his speed fell drastically.\n\nFang Yuan and the others were overjoyed, Qie Shi Min shouted: “As expected, killing the captives had an effect! Quick, kill him, we can still search his soul later.”\n\nFang Yuan and the others quickly got ahead, but at this time, Dong Fang Chang Fan’s expression changed, he showed a smile, as if his plot had succeeded.\n\n“Oh no, it’s a trap!” Fang Yuan quickly retreated, but it was too late to escape!\n\nHe only saw a ray of starlight, it moved extremely quickly, it grazed Fang Yuan’s shoulder and pierced into Qie Shi Min’s forehead.\n\nQie Shi Min expression was frozen into a look of utter disbelief.\n\nAt the next moment, his head exploded, the chariot disassembled as he fell to the ground weakly.\n\nBe it Fang Yuan or Pi Shui Han, they were shocked and nervous. It was already so late into the battle, to think that Dong Fang Chang Fan still had such a powerful trump card!\n\nHe had truly unfathomable depths!!\n\n“If you pursue me any further, Qie Shi Min can serve as an example!” Dong Fang Chang Fan laughed loudly, escaping again.\n\nEarlier, he lost control, that was only him acting, a trap!\n\nQie Shi Min was an enslavement path Gu Immortal, he had a weaker body than normal immortals, because he was chasing fervently, he was slightly careless, but he actually got killed in one move.\n\n“Chase him! He is bluffing!” Pi Shui Han was stunned for a moment before reacting.\n\nFang Yuan was also pursuing closely: “After this attack, he really has nothing left.”\n\nAlthough his tone was certain, Fang Yuan did not believe it completely inwardly.\n\nIf it were other Gu Immortals, that would definitely be the case. But it was Dong Fang Chang Fan, this old scoundrel, this was not a certainty.\n\nAfter Qie Shi Min died, there were no captives left to lure Dong Fang Chang Fan to lose control.\n\nThis was terrible news.\n\nIf they stayed and looted Qie Shi Min’s immortal aperture and Immortal Gu, then they would not make it in time, Dong Fang Chang Fan would manage to escape.\n\nHonestly speaking, even though they were still chasing him, Fang Yuan and Pi Shui Han did not have much hope within themselves.\n\nBut quickly, there was another change.\n\nDong Fang Chang Fan’s speed became slower.\n\nHis speed fell by thirty percent compared to earlier!\n\nWith this, Fang Yuan and Pi Shui Han saw hope.\n\n“As expected, his burst speed has its limits.”\n\n“Think about it, that is an immortal killer move, if he could use it for extended periods of time, he would have used it long ago.”\n\n“Maybe his immortal essence was used up.”\n\nFang Yuan and Pi Shui Han interacted, they decided to work together for now, to leave Dong Fang Chang Fan no room to escape.\n\nThey were also worried that if they fought between themselves, at the crucial moment, they might end in failure.\n\nBut just as they were getting closer to Dong Fang Chang Fan, his body flickered as another figure appeared, turning into a second Dong Fang Chang Fan.\n\n“This?!” Fang Yuan was shocked.\n\nPi Shui Han gasped: “Oh no, I’ve heard long ago that Dong Fang Chang Fan had a split shadow Immortal Gu in his hands, to think that it was true!”\n\nThe two bodies had the same aura, they were identical, there was nothing that could differentiate them, they flew off in two different directions.\n\nEven though the pursuers were using investigative methods, they could not find any flaws.\n\nThere was no choice, Fang Yuan and Pi Shui Han could only split up.\n\nIn the end, not long after Fang Yuan went on his chase, Dong Fang Chang Fan split out another figure and flew towards the left.\n\nFang Yuan was joyful and also worried.\n\nThis indicated that he had been chasing the right figure, but he did not expect that this old scoundrel Dong Fang could create another split shadow.\n\nFang Yuan quickly took out some Dong Fang tribe Gu Master captives in his immortal aperture, shouting in the same manner again: “Dong Fang Chang Fan, I will kill your tribesmen again!”\n\nFang Yuan had used his strength path giant hands earlier to attack the assembly points, he killed large numbers of Dong Fang tribesmen. But in this process, he had left a backup plan, he secretly kept a good number of the captives in his immortal aperture.\n\nBut the two Dong Fang Chang Fans did not pay heed to him, Fang Yuan’s plan did not succeed.\n\nHe could not differentiate them, he could only grit his teeth as he chose the left one randomly, pursuing it.\n\nAlong the way, in just a short while, Dong Fang Chang Fan created another clone and flew in two directions.\n\nFang Yuan felt anything but reassured in his mind, what should he do now?\n\nHis immortal essence was almost used up completely, the strength path giant hands could only move slowly, and ordinary mortal killer moves could not even damage Dong Fang Chang Fan’s clothes."
