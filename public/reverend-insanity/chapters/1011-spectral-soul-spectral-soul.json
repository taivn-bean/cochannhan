Spectral Soul!\n\n**Translator:** Atlas Studios **Editor:** Atlas Studios\n\nThe immortals present could not believe their own eyes!\n\nZither mind tribulation, star flow tribulation, these two grand tribulations were easily stopped by Spectral Soul, it was as easy as drinking water.\n\n“This, this is the might of a rank nine demon venerable?” Fang Yuan’s heart shook.\n\nSpectral Soul was already dead, what was present now was merely his soul.\n\nThis gigantic soul was already beyond normal form.\n\nHe was thousands of meters tall, like an imposing giant! The dark clouds that the ten extreme immortal zombie lifeless formation created merely reached the height of his waist.\n\nFang Yuan and the others were in the air, resembling flies. Looking at Spectral Soul’s leg, it resembled a giant mountain peak.\n\nSpectral Soul’s chest had reached the clouds, he was as tall as the sky!\n\nHe had three heads.\n\nThe front head had dragon horns, a lion’s mane, snake eyes, and elephant tusks.\n\nThe left head had a peach-colored forehead, hair like grass, and three flower-like eyes.\n\nThe right head had a fringe of clouds, eyes resembling lightning, ears like fire, and a golden mouth.\n\nHe had a thousand arms, five hundred on each side. They were dark like ink, his muscles were bulging with firm lines, oozing with demonic aura.\n\nHe also had a thousand ghostly hands, earlier, Heavenly Court had spent huge effort to use Embroidered Tower to immobilize a ghostly hand to the ground, but that was merely one out of a thousand!\n\n“Ah! This appearance, this appearance! Don’t tell me? Impossible! Impossible!” Fairy Li Shan had recognized Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, she screamed in disbelief. Her arms were covering her head, she shook her head as she retreated, she lost all the grace that a rank seven Gu Immortal had.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable’s appearance was not a secret, it was widely spread in the Gu Immortal world, even in the mortal world it was well known.\n\nEspecially in Southern Border, many villages and countless mortals had a culture of revering Spectral Soul Demon Venerable. The people used clay to create a statue of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, and would pray to it during festivals and offerings.\n\nHei Lou Lan’s pupils shrunk to pin size, she was so shocked she could not speak, her entire body was shivering.\n\nGulp, Tai Bai Yun Sheng swallowed his saliva, his body was covered in cold sweat.\n\nFang Yuan showed a moved expression full of anticipation.\n\nHis shock from earlier had vanished.\n\n“This… is the limit of soul path? The soul turns from phantom to solid, it can interfere with the material world, it is as condensed as a physical body, and is unbelievably powerful! Such a soul foundation definitely surpasses a hundred million man soul. My soul compared to it, is like an ant versus the moon…”\n\n“But even the powerful Spectral Soul Demon Venerable died in the end, his soul returning to the door of life and death. Now that he has broken out, defying heaven and fate, what is he trying to do?”\n\n“When can I reach such a level as well? But even at this level, he cannot avoid death. I pursue eternal life… does it truly exist?”\n\nFang Yuan’s eyes shined with bright light, at this moment, he felt greatly excited.\n\nEven as an immortal zombie, he could feel a sensation of hot-bloodedness!\n\nOne could learn from examples set by capable people.\n\nSpectral Soul Demon Venerable was a predecessor who was undeniably a forerunner of Gu cultivation.\n\nEven Fang Yuan, who had five hundred years of experience, was small like a fly when he was facing Spectral Soul Demon Venerable!\n\nBut Fang Yuan’s fear had gone away entirely.\n\nHe felt deep excitement, it was feverish!\n\nLike a person who aspires to climb the highest mountain seeing an immeasurably tall peak, even if that was not the goal, he still feel deeply motivated and wanted to climb up, to surpass it!\n\nFang Yuan had long since forgotten about death.\n\nIf he died on the path of ascension, even if his corpse was desecrated and his soul was utterly destroyed, so what?\n\nThis was the goal that he pursued!\n\nBam!!\n\nAt this moment, Heaven Overseeing Tower burst out with a grand light, it shattered Spectral Soul’s ghostly hand and regained freedom.\n\nIt was a rank nine Immortal Gu House after all.\n\nInside the tower, the atmosphere was extremely heavy.\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals bit their lips, seeing this overwhelming giant, they felt great pressure in their hearts.\n\n“As expected of Spectral Soul, such vast demonic might, it is simply terrifying!” Heaven Overseeing Tower Lord laughed loudly, the aura in his body rose as his silvery hair swayed, his sleeves were fluttering like a war banner.\n\nHis fighting spirit soon spread to the other Heavenly Court Gu Immortals.\n\nThe immortals’ eyes burned with passion.\n\n“Heaven’s will cannot be defied!”\n\n“Heaven cannot be defied!”\n\n“Even if you are Spectral Soul Demon Venerable, who had once slaughtered the world and caused endless bloodshed.”\n\n“Your era is over!”\n\n“Even if we die today, we will protect the Great Dao of heaven!!”\n\n“Come, activate Heaven Overseeing Tower.”\n\nThe immortals had firm determination, Heaven Overseeing Tower shined with an unprecedented dazzling light.\n\nSpectral Soul’s left head looked at it as it growled, several hands were moving around.\n\nThe entirety of Spectral Soul moved with a speed disproportionate to its size. In an instant, several hands grabbed Heaven Overseeing Tower tightly.\n\nMore and more ghostly hands emerged, overlapping over one another, surrounding Heaven Overseeing Tower in the center.\n\nHeavenly Court’s Gu Immortals were unrelenting, Heaven Overseeing Tower’s light shone through the crevices of the ghostly hands’ fingers, shooting out light that resembled sharp blades.\n\nMore than ten ghostly hands had layered together, but they shook vaguely.\n\nSpectral Soul, after getting to this point, actually ignored Heaven Overseeing Tower, the three heads looked towards the sky, having grim expressions.\n\nEven though he was several thousand meters tall, the sky was taller, it was still above his head.\n\nAs if angered by Spectral Soul’s arrogance, the deepest part of the sky was conjuring the strongest thunderstorm it could muster.\n\nAn apocalyptic feeling engulfed the immortals.\n\n“This… is no longer a grand tribulation.”\n\n“This is a myriad tribulation! Apocalyptic myriad tribulation!”\n\nShadow Sect’s Gu Immortals were lost for words.\n\nBeyond grand tribulations, there were myriad tribulations.\n\nMyriad tribulations were terrifying, if a rank eight Gu Immortal passed all three, they would become a rank nine venerable!\n\nHeaven was enraged, it knew that grand tribulations were useless against Spectral Soul, thus, it conjured a myriad tribulation.\n\nMyriad tribulation — Wind Lightning Prison!\n\nFast! Fast! Fast!\n\nThe myriad tribulation descended faster than any Gu Immortal’s expectations.\n\nCountless lightning bolts descended from the sky, countless tornadoes coiled around Spectral Soul’s body like pythons and dragons.\n\nSpectral Soul’s three heads roared at the sky angrily. His six eyes shot out blood-red light that was oozing with killing intent, it had an intimidating aura.\n\nA thousand arms moved together, ghostly hands tore the tornadoes apart while his hill-like fists punched against the lightning bolts in the sky.\n\nHei Lou Lan and the others could not speak anymore.\n\nThe scene in front of them was like the reenactment of a legendary tale.\n\nThe myriad tribulation was targeting Spectral Soul and the ten extreme formation. Fang Yuan and the others were inside the formation, they were rather safe.\n\n“This myriad tribulation’s power is much higher than ordinary ones!”\n\n“Our main body can endure it.”\n\n“The ten extreme formation?”\n\n“It has been refined by sixty percent already.”\n\n“Only sixty percent… the following tribulations will become more terrifying.”\n\nSaying this, Shadow Sect’s Gu Immortals became silent.\n\nTheir real archenemy was not Heavenly Court or Fang Yuan, it was heaven!\n\nIf they were in their complete state, Shadow Sect’s group was confident. But because of Heavenly Court and Fang Yuan, they were in an incomplete state, in fact, the ten extreme formation had almost been about to break earlier, they only salvaged it by sacrificing Zombie Alliance.\n\n“Sacred Feather City is lost, and our main body has appeared, we serve little purpose now.”\n\n“That’s right, we should sacrifice ourselves to the ten extreme formation and save some time, that is the best way.”\n\n“Then, what about those people?”\n\n“Leave them to us.” Ying Wu Xie spoke this as he looked at Bo Qing.\n\nThe later tribulations would be more powerful. Shadow Sect’s Gu Immortals had little use in resisting the tribulations. They might as well use themselves to accelerate the refinement of the formation.\n\nThe true identity of these Shadow Sect Gu Immortals was that they were Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s split souls.\n\nPrecisely because of this, Shadow Sect could remain mysterious and hide in the background, developing for so many years without exposing themselves.\n\nThis was also why Shadow Sect’s Gu Immortals disregarded death, they were united and did not care about sacrifice.\n\nThis huge force was simply a one man show by Spectral Soul Demon Venerable!\n\nAfter discussion, Shadow Sect’s Gu Immortals, including Seven Star Child and Song Zi Xing, made the same choice as Old Man Yan Shi, they entered the formation and sacrificed themselves.\n\nOnly two people were left.\n\nOne was Ying Wu Xie, he had the Pure Dream Reality Seeker Physique, his cultivation level also rose as time passed. At the last moments of his life, he would fully become rank nine, he was the final trump card of Spectral Soul.\n\nThe other was immortal zombie Bo Qing, he had also been one of Spectral Soul Demon Venerable’s split souls, but right now, he was only Bo Qing’s immortal zombie body, the remnant soul inside was not Bo Qing but Mo Yao.\n\nMo Yao’s remnant soul would not help in the formation even if she went in, she could only be refined as immortal material. This was not worth it, thus she stayed behind.\n\nCurrently, Spectral Soul was controlling the situation, resisting the myriad tribulation while suppressing Heaven Overseeing Tower.\n\nImmortal zombie Bo Qing and Ying Wu Xie had no more worries, they charged towards Fang Yuan and the others.\n\nFang Yuan and the others were not their match, they quickly retreated.\n\nBut being encircled by the formation, and with space path methods sealed, where could they run to?\n\nBo Qing waved his hand and sword light flew out, chopping off Fairy Li Shan’s head as blood spewed out of her neck.\n\nThe Sword Immortal’s strength could not be resisted.\n\nMan as Before!\n\nAt the crucial moment, Tai Bai Yun Sheng activated man as before Immortal Gu.\n\nFairy Li Shan returned to her former state, touching her neck, her eyes were filled with fear.\n\nImmortal zombie Bo Qing’s arms were behind his back, he laughed arrogantly: “Merely a rank six time path Immortal Gu, how can it stop me?”\n\nAs he said this, Fairy Li Shan’s eyes widened as sword qi burst out of her body, turning her into a pile of mushy flesh.\n\n“Little aunt!” Hei Lou Lan cried out in pain, her eyes were bright red as she charged towards Bo Qing.\n\nYing Wu Xie blocked Fang Yuan.\n\nHe stared at Fang Yuan intently: “Fang Yuan, you were actually able to leave my dream realm, very interesting. Then, with my rank eight cultivation level, I want to see if you can escape from it again!”\n\n“You know my name?” Fang Yuan growled, feeling something amiss.\n\n“Hehehe, you are an otherworldly demon, you are still useful to Shadow Sect, I will spare your life. Don’t think of using Spring Autumn Cicada, this rank six Immortal Gu has already been deduced by Old Man Yan Shi. In its current state, it cannot be used, isn’t that right?” Ying Wu Xie was confident of victory, he approached with a smile.\n\n“What?!” Fang Yuan’s entire body shook."
