Thus, outsiders like Fang Yuan would think that Kong Ri Tian is in my hands. Thus, he came to me for Sheng Tian true inheritance.”\n\nWu Yong thought: “My actions earlier were not good enough. I should have announced immediately that Kong Ri Tian was captured by my Wu clan!”\n\nEven though that was not true, if Wu clan publicized that, Kong Ri Tian would not come out to refute him anyway.\n\nIf Kong Ri Tian exposed himself, the Gu Immortals that were after Sheng Tian true inheritance would charge towards him like jackals, they would tear his weak little body to shreds.\n\n“If Kong Ri Tian hears such an announcement from my Wu clan, he will also understand our motive. Keeping Hu Land a secret will also be ensuring his safety, he will not reject it.”\n\nWu Yong had another plan, he could make up for his previous mistake.\n\nHu Land was a secluded domain of heaven and earth, it had immense value, if Wu clan wanted to own it, he would need to do it in secret!\n\n“I can let you have Sheng Tian true inheritance.” Wu Yong rapidly transmitted and replied Ke Xin Hong.\n\nFor Hu Land, giving up Sheng Tian true inheritance was a wise decision.\n\nMoreover, this Sheng Tian true inheritance had just been obtained by Wu clan, it had contents but not Immortal Gu. The Immortal Gu and immortal essence were still in Kong Ri Tian’s hands.\n\nKe Xin Hong was slightly stunned.\n\nWu Yong agreed so readily, it was out of his expectations.\n\nHe was a Gu Immortal expert of Mushroomman Paradise, after Lu Wei Yin submitted to Fang Yuan along with the entire paradise, he became Fang Yuan’s subordinate.\n\nThis was the first mission that Fang Yuan gave him.\n\nWhen Ke Xin Hong received this mission, he felt great internal pressure. He had heard of Wu Yong’s name long ago, along the way, he was thinking of what to do if Wu Yong rejected or refused to agree with this.\n\nTo think that he would agree so easily after they met.\n\n“I finally understand the might and prestige of my lord now.” Ke Xin Hong sighed internally, filled with deep emotions.\n\nKe Xin Hong added: “Lord Wu Yong, my lord is willing to pay for the entire Sheng Tian true inheritance.”\n\nIt was Wu Yong’s turn to be stunned.\n\nHearing Ke Xin Hong’s words, it seemed like Fang Yuan wanted a fair trade? He was not going to extort or snatch it by force?\n\nWu Yong quickly reacted, he listed his condition.\n\nKe Xin Hong frowned slightly, because Wu Yong wanted a rank nine wind path immortal material, it was quite rare in the market.\n\nKe Xin Hong could not decide this alone, he quickly communicated with Fang Yuan.\n\nAfter receiving an answer, Ke Xin Hong started to smile again as he looked at Wu Yong.\n\nUsing treasure yellow heaven, this transaction was quickly completed.\n\nFang Yuan obtained the full details of Sheng Tian true inheritance, while Wu Yong obtained a rank nine wind path immortal material.\n\n“Fang Yuan has a large number of grotto-heavens from the two heavens, it is not strange that he has rare immortal materials. But he really went ahead to transact with me?!”\n\nSurprisingly getting a rank nine wind path immortal material, Wu Yong’s preparatory work for refining eight-faced prestige wind Immortal Gu achieved a significant breakthrough.\n\nBut Wu Yong could not be happy!\n\nFang Yuan had the battle strength to snatch Sheng Tian true inheritance but he did not do that.\n\nHe only sent a mushroomman Gu Immortal and expressed his sincerity in making a fair trade, afterwards, he held his word and paid with a rank nine wind path immortal material.\n\n“Fang Yuan is truly amazing!” Wu Yong sighed deeply.\n\nAs the saying goes, an expert swimmer would eventually drown, an expert combatant would die in battle, relying on one’s specialty without possessing other skills was a dangerous thing.\n\nOnce people started to rely on something, they would unknowingly stay within their comfort zone, they would develop a mental pattern. When they encounter problems, they would use their specialty trait to resolve the issues, as time passes, all of their other methods and perspectives would vanish. Eventually, they would face the greatest predicament of their lives, it might be their end.\n\nBut Fang Yuan did not do that.\n\nHe had great battle strength and could snatch the true inheritance, but if he did that, he would waste a lot of time and energy, there was even a chance of failing.\n\nAfter all, the information could be erased.\n\nBut using this transaction, Fang Yuan easily obtained Sheng Tian true inheritance without a hitch.\n\nWu Yong analyzed: “This can mean at least two things.”\n\n“Firstly, Fang Yuan has a lot of immortal materials, one rank nine wind path immortal material is not important in his eyes!”\n\n“Secondly, even though he is the number one person in the world, he still keeps his composure and scheming mind, he does not overly rely on his strength. Sigh, it would have been great if I managed to kill him back then. Fang Yuan has already grown fully, with such a nature, he is too terrifying.”\n\nWhen Sheng Tian true inheritance’s transaction ended, Fang Yuan’s main body was already in Western Desert.\n\nWestern Desert, Fang clan’s headquarters.\n\nFang clan’s supreme elders were almost fully gathered, they stared at Fang Yuan like he was a fatal enemy.\n\n“Everyone, don’t be too nervous, really, I came here to make a transaction with Fang clan.” Fang Yuan smiled.\n\nBut Fang clan’s immortals felt huge pressure weighing on them.\n\nFang clan’s first supreme elder Fang Gong said: “Is it our fortune or misfortune to have received your attention?”\n\n“Everyone, we have quite the relationship actually.” Fang Yuan started to activate his killer move.\n\nAs the aura leaked, all of Fang clan’s Gu Immortals stood up from their seats, they quickly activated their Immortal Gu, a battle was about to start.\n\n“Fang Yuan, what are you doing?”\n\n“This is our Fang clan’s headquarters!”\n\n“Earlier when we were outside, you said you wanted to make a transaction, if you attack now, who will believe your words in the future?”\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals called out with intense nervousness.\n\nFang Yuan smiled coldly: “If I wanted to harm you, I could have attacked from the start, can your Fang clan stop me?”\n\nAs he said so, his appearance changed.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals were shocked: “Suan Bu Jin?”\n\nFang Yuan activated familiar face again, changing into another appearance.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals saw Fang Yuan’s appearance, they became shocked again: “Fang Di Chang?”\n\nFang Yun frowned, he was the adopted son of Fang Di Chang, seeing Fang Yuan’s transformation, he felt repulsed: “Lord Fang Yuan, did you come all the way to our clan just for this display of transformations to mock us?”\n\nFang Yuan looked at Fang Yun, saying with deep meaning: “Yun Er, during this time when I was gone, why didn’t you convert to wisdom path? Father gave you three wisdom path Immortal Gu and even my wisdom path inheritance. Fang clan has no wisdom path Gu Immortal at the moment, if you do not take up this responsibility, who will?”\n\n“You, you!” Fang Yun pointed at Fang Yuan, he stared with wide opened eyes, filled with shock.\n\nThe other Fang clan Gu Immortals also had a change of expression.\n\nThey realized something from his words, they had a guess regarding the truth, the reality of it made them sink into panic.\n\n“Indeed, I am Suan Bu Jin, who also became Fang Di Chang later on. I have interacted with you guys much more than you think.” Fang Yuan looked around as he laughed heartily.\n\nFang Gong’s expression was livid, he could not wait anymore, he stood out: “What evidence do you have?”\n\nFang Yuan gave a bunch of evidence to the Fang clan Gu Immortals as he transmitted to Fang Gong, snickering: “Fang Gong, you and Fang Di Chang decided to sacrifice Suan Bu Jin to refine Divine Bean Palace, do you really want me to expose it?”\n\nFang Yuan not only had evidence, he even had accurate facts, Fang clan soon realized the whole story.\n\n“So Fang Yuan infiltrated our Fang clan long ago!”\n\n“He even became our external supreme elder!”\n\n“Oh heavens, even our second supreme elder Fang Di Chang was replaced by him, we did not even notice!!”\n\nAfter Fang clan’s Gu Immortals realized the truth, they all turned pale as cold sweat broke out.\n\nIt was too terrifying.\n\nIf not for Fang Yuan’s reveal, they would still think that Fang Di Chang was currently trapped inside Divine Emperor City.\n\nEver since the fate war ended, Fang clan had been trying to negotiate with Heavenly Court to get back their supreme elder Fang Di Chang.\n\n“This means that Divine Bean Palace trapped your clone, while our second supreme elder died at your hands!” Fang Gong looked at Fang Yuan with a cold gaze.\n\nFang Gong was tall and sturdy, with long white hair and beard spreading around his head like a lion’s mane, he had bulging muscles that resembled rocks. Facing the murderer of his second supreme elder, if it were any other person, he would have attacked already.\n\nBut against Fang Yuan, he could only restrain himself, he looked at Fang Yuan with a complex gaze, there was anger and hatred in his eyes, but also helplessness and wariness.\n\nFang Yuan was too strong, his demonic might was unparalleled, his reputation was unmatched, Fang Gong did not dare to make a rash move!\n\nFang Yuan continued: “Saying that Fang Di Chang died at my hands is both correct and also wrong. Fang Di Chang’s body is destroyed but his soul is in my hands, do you want it back?”\n\nBack then, to avoid the detection of soul lantern Gu, Fang Yuan did not kill Fang Di Chang, he only separated his body and soul.\n\nFang Di Chang’s soul was still kept in Fang Yuan’s hands.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals heard this, they became excited.\n\n“Fang Di Chang’s soul is in your hands?”\n\n“Great, our second supreme elder can be saved!”\n\n“No wonder Central Continent has been so vague all this time, so they did not even have our second supreme elder in the first place.”\n\n“In the current world, Fate has been destroyed, as long as Fang Di Chang’s soul is around, if he gets a Gu Immortal body, he would return to Fang clan again.”\n\n“If this Gu Immortal body cultivates wisdom path, then after Fang Di Chang revives, he will be an immense help to your entire clan!”\n\n“Now tell me, friends from Fang clan, do you want to make a transaction with me?” Fang Yuan stated his ultimatum.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals were silent, they looked at Fang Gong.\n\nAt the crucial moment, only a rank eight Gu Immortal like Fang Gong could make the decision!"
