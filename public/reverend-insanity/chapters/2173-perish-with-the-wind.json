Very good, I will kill you, even if you are Yellow Earth Great World’s sage!”\n\nLu Wei Yin shook his head: “I am no sage. Bu Tian Kong, your killing intent is too overbearing.”\n\nLu Wei Yin had to take action against Bu Tian Kong personally.\n\nBu Tian Kong killed too many Gu Immortals, if it was not stopped, the overall situation of this Gu Immortal battle would be affected.\n\nBoom boom boom!\n\nLu Wei Yin and Bu Tian Kong exchanged blows.\n\nThis time, Bu Tian Kong was finally suppressed.\n\nEven though it was strong and could kill many rank eight Gu Immortals, it was still not pseudo venerable level. In contrast, even though Lu Wei Yin lacked offense, his defense was firmly in the realm of pseudo venerable level.\n\nLu Wei Yin endured Bu Tian Kong’s fierce attacks with much energy to spare.\n\n“You are not a sage, yet you are so strong already?! Good, very good!”\n\n“Come and attack me, try and kill me, I have not sensed any fatal killing intent against me for some time already.”\n\n“Why are you not attacking? Why do you only defend yourself?”\n\n“Are your attacks so weak and useless? You are too disappointing!!”\n\nThe rock monkey continued to shout as it moved rapidly like lightning in the sky, its attacks were like furious lightning bolts from heaven, its power was rising endlessly.\n\nBut Lu Wei Yin got distracted.\n\nBecause he heard that Fang Yuan had already left for Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space at the center.\n\n“Oh no!”\n\n“Lord Fang Yuan, please stop.”\n\n“Even though that small world might contain Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance, it will be targeted by Heavenly Court and Longevity Heaven together.”\n\n“Heavenly Court has already sent their main troops, there are many Immortal Gu Houses and Gu Immortals. Longevity Heaven has also sent Calamity Luck Altar.”\n\n“Now is not the time for a climactic battle, if Star Constellation Immortal Venerable attacks Paradise Earth’s tomb while you are away, what will we do?”\n\nLu Wei Yin transmitted time and again, but Fang Yuan did not even respond to it.\n\nLu Wei Yin gritted his teeth, his expression turning unsightly.\n\n“No matter how strong Fang Yuan is, he is still just a pseudo venerable, he is not a true venerable.”\n\n“I need to help him!”\n\n“If Star Constellation Immortal Venerable shows up and kills him, who will protect Paradise Earth’s tomb, who will stall for the crucial time?”\n\nWhile thinking of this, Lu Wei Yin’s vision suddenly turned dark.\n\nBam.\n\nAt the next moment, rock monkey Bu Tian Kong’s fist landed squarely on Lu Wei Yin’s face.\n\n“You dare to be distracted? You are looking down on me, you will pay a terrible price!” Bu Tian Kong shouted.\n\nBu Tian Kong flew towards Lu Wei Yin as they got closer again.\n\nLu Wei Yin was forced to retreat, he quickly used his killer move.\n\nIt started to rain.\n\nTribulation rain fell on Bu Tian Kong’s body, greatly slowing it down while also corroding its defenses.\n\nAt the same time, Lu Wei Yin’s killer move showed effect.\n\nYellowish brown dust started to appear below Bu Tian Kong, they moved around and gradually sealed it.\n\n“Get lost, get lost!” Bu Tian Kong shouted, using killer moves in a frenzy, trying to sweep away all of the rain and dust surrounding it.\n\nBut the rain and dust gathered together increasingly, eventually sealing it entirely.\n\nA lump of soil that trapped Bu Tian Kong fell from the sky, after landing on the ground, it turned into a huge soil mountain.\n\n“Just stay put here.” Lu Wei Yin immediately flew towards Thieving Heaven’s space.\n\n“No!”\n\n“I won’t give in, these things cannot hold me down!”\n\n“Roar—!”\n\nBu Tian Kong shouted, its voice resounding like thunder as it reverberated in the battlefield.\n\nWith a loud sound, the mountain was shattered, dust clouds emerged, from within the broken rocks, it flew out again.\n\n“What?” Lu Wei Yin was stunned.\n\nBu Tian Kong’s performance was out of his expectation, how could it escape so quickly?\n\nBu Tian Kong resisted the tribulations while flying to catch up to Lu Wei Yin.\n\nBoom!\n\nThe two exchanged killer moves again, while Lu Wei Yin was held back this time.\n\n“This monkey’s killer moves are getting stronger, so that’s it.” Lu Wei Yin understood at this moment.\n\nThe tribulations were aiding Bu Tian Kong all along, as long as it was not killed, it would continue to undergo tribulations and gain more dao marks, that was why Bu Tian Kong got increasingly stronger as it fought.\n\n“I want this heaven… to no longer shroud my vision!” Bu Tian Kong shouted as it used a move that shot out a rainbow, sweeping away the dark clouds of the surrounding five hundred li.\n\n“I want this earth… to no longer bury my heart!” Bu Tian Kong shouted as it stomped on the ground, mountains collapsed, as Lu Wei Yin, who had his defensive method broken through, watched in surprise.\n\nBu Tian Kong was already in a state of insanity, it found Fang Yuan who was not far away, it abandoned Lu Wei Yin and went for Fang Yuan instead!\n\n“Be careful!” Lu Wei Yin quickly advised: “This monkey is not simple.”\n\nFang Yuan did not turn around, it was as if he heard nothing, he only looked at the subspace in front of him.\n\nBu Tian Kong moved rapidly and seemingly teleported behind Fang Yuan.\n\n“I want all life… to understand my intention! I want this sage… to perish with the wind!!” Bu Tian Kong shouted, activating the strongest killer move it had used in its life.\n\nWinds, clouds, and thunder roared, the world changed colors at this moment!\n\n“Hmm?” Fang Yuan turned around slightly, waving his hand lightly towards the back.\n\nAt the next moment, Bu Tian Kong fell like a comet, crossing the entire battlefield and slamming into several mountains.\n\nAfter a chain of loud explosions, it created a huge gorge of several kilometers on the ground.\n\nFinally, it lay on the ground, its eyes were wide open but it did not move at all.\n\nIt was dead.\n\nThe unceasing chaotic battles and heated battlefields turned silent at this moment.\n\nNie Kuang Feng, who was unstoppable and killing everything in its path, froze in its reddish brown demonic wind state.\n\nFang Yuan cast his glance upon it.\n\nNie Kuang Feng shuddered immediately.\n\nAt the next moment, endless fear filled its mind and body!\n\n“I will die, I will die, I am going to die!!”\n\nIt went out of its demonized state, immediately gaining clarity.\n\n“Escape!!”\n\nIt quickly flew away, ignoring its opponent, Xiao He Jian.\n\nXiao He Jian was heavily injured and was on the verge of death, he had no way to fight back, with just one attack, he would die.\n\nHe stared with a dumbfounded look as Nie Kuang Feng escaped from the battlefield in a crazed state.\n\nFang Yuan turned around again, looking at Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space with a calm expression.\n\nHe turned to look at Heavenly Court’s army, Divine Emperor City and Demon Judgment Board were arriving soon.\n\nHe looked at the other side.\n\nLongevity Heaven’s Calamity Luck Altar shined with a golden aurora, it was arriving too.\n\nA cold and ruthless light flashed in Fang Yuan’s eyes for a moment, he turned into a white ray of light as he entered Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space.\n\n“Charge, we will fight inside!” Fairy Yu Xiu immediately ordered.\n\nOnce Heavenly Court’s Immortal Gu Houses arrived, they also entered Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space.\n\nThey could not use their full strength outside, if they went past the limit, they would face Limitless Demon Venerable’s retaliative method.\n\nAt the same time, it was easier to destroy Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance space from the inside.\n\nFang Yuan’s vision changed rapidly, when he regained his sight, he was already in this true inheritance space.\n\nEvery true inheritance space that Thieving Heaven left behind could be considered an artificial secluded domain.\n\nThis was a strange space, it had warm lights but no mountains, rivers, wind, or land, it was completely empty.\n\nBut there were some peculiarities in here, there were black lines that extended everywhere, covering every inch of the space.\n\nThese lines were either thick or thin, they all gave off a terrifying aura that Fang Yuan felt fearful towards.\n\nAt the same time, he felt familiarity in this aura.\n\nHe quickly thought of the mysterious black fire in the blue dragon whale’s grotto-heaven.\n\nEven though Fang Yuan did not know what happened three hundred thousand years ago, after seeing this, he realized immediately: “It seems that this true inheritance space is going to collapse soon. I need to quickly comprehend the mysteries here and decipher where the true inheritance really is.”\n\nThe last time he entered a true inheritance space of Thieving Heaven, he obtained ghostly concealment.\n\nThat time, Fang Yuan went in through open door Gu and close door Gu. At that time, the true inheritance space was very stable, it had many winds of assimilation tornadoes inside. Only an otherworldly demon could dispel the wind by touching them.\n\nBecause of that, Fang Yuan accidentally saved Feng Jiu Ge.\n\nAfter all the tornadoes had vanished, Fang Yuan successfully obtained ghostly concealment, it was a smooth process.\n\nBut this space was different.\n\nThere were no tornadoes at all, if Thieving Heaven’s true inheritance really existed here, it would be hidden deeply and would require deductions.\n\nBut Fang Yuan was not rushing to make deductions, he took out a formation from his immortal aperture and placed it within this space.\n\nIt was the five regional limit formation.\n\nThe five regional limit formation activated, five colored smoke spewed out.\n\nIn a few breaths of time, five colored smoke spread out in the surrounding ten li, it was so dense that one could not see their own fingers.\n\nAfter Heavenly Court’s troops entered Thieving Heaven’s space, they went inside the five colored smoke and immediately felt suppressed.\n\n“These are… the five region’s regional walls?!”"
