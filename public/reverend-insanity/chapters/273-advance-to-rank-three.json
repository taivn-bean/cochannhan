A gush of primeval essence crashed towards the aperture walls.\n\nThe waves were like snow, shining in a silver light, brilliant beyond comprehension, this was the snow silver primeval essence.\n\nIn the room, Bai Ning Bing’s palms were stuck to Fang Yuan’s back as the bone flesh unity Gu sent primeval essence continuously into Fang Yuan’s aperture.\n\nOnce the primeval essence was converted by the bone flesh unity Gu and became Fang Yuan’s, he could utilize them.\n\nFang Yuan used the endless amount of snow silver primeval essence and assaulted his aperture walls.\n\nHe was now rank two peak stage, his primeval essence was deep red, and his aperture walls were of a crystal form, transparent and shiny.\n\nInitially, in order to breakthrough from rank one peak stage to rank two on Qing Mao mountain, he had to use primeval stones to help him, and after three to four days, he barely succeeded. It was an arduous process.\n\nWhen he tried to breakthrough into rank three, because of his talent, he had to use the man-beast life burial Gu, an external force.\n\nBut now, it was completely different.\n\nNot only because his aptitude had risen to A grade ninety percent, and no longer needed the man-beast life burial Gu, he even had the assistance of Bai Ning Bing.\n\nHuman encounters were really mysterious and unpredictable. Even Fang Yuan did not see this coming.\n\nThe tough crystal walls, under the impact of the snow silver primeval essence, started to develop cracks.\n\nThe cracks grew rapidly, expanding and spreading. A moment later, the entire wall was filled with cracks.\n\n_Crack crack…_\n\nThe crystal wall shattered, and numerous crystal fragments fell into the primeval sea, causing waves to splash.\n\nSoon after, these fragments turned into white spots, dispersing in the primeval sea.\n\nA brand new white light wall, replaced the crystal wall.\n\nAt the same time, a trace of light silver primeval essence appeared from deep within the sea.\n\nLight silver primeval essence, it was the symbol of rank three initial stage.\n\nAt this point, Fang Yuan finally broke through rank two peak stage, and achieved rank three.\n\nNot mentioning rank six Gu immortal, rank three was already in the middle spectrum of strength. Be it righteous or demonic, they were a strong force.\n\n“After leaving Qing Mao mountain, in less than a year, I regained my rank three cultivation. This speed, is over three times of when I was on Qing Mao mountain, and with my A grade aptitude, my future is bright.” Fang Yuan clenched his fist, cheering in his heart.\n\nLooking at the time, only six hours passed.\n\nSo fast.\n\nIf he used his own effort, he could breakthrough as well, but it would take twenty four hours at least.\n\nSnow silver primeval essence, it truly was the most effective.\n\nChecking his aperture once again.\n\nThe sea of bone spear Gu, spiral bone spear Gu had all been sold.\n\nOver half of the deep red rank two peak stage primeval essence remained.\n\nBai Ning Bing’s did not stop injecting her primeval essence.\n\nA gush of snow silver primeval essence fell from the sky like a waterfall into the primeval sea, and after some turbulence, it sank to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThe higher the realm, the better the quality of the primeval essence. Red steel primeval essence and light silver primeval essence could only be pushed up by the snow silver primeval essence.\n\nAt the bottom of the primeval sea, a bone-like white and blue flower moved along with the sea currents.\n\nIt was the rank three heavenly essence treasure lotus. The “movable primeval spring”, able to produce fifty primeval stones a day.\n\nBeside the pure treasure lotus was the demonic blood skull Gu.\n\nThe blood colored skull had two eye sockets, glowing with a purple flame.\n\nNear the blood skull Gu, there was a crystal ball, staying motionless.\n\nInside the crystal ball, there was a thick mist that formed into an old man that gave off an immortal aura.\n\nThe old man carried a walking cane, with a thick beard on his face, showing a calm expression.\n\nIt was the primeval elder Gu.\n\nThe old man was originally laughing and smiling, but after Fang Yuan took out half his primeval stones, his expression turned plain.\n\nThere was also another jade pendant-like beetle fossil, half transparent and jade green, it gave off cooling air.\n\nIt was the rank two clearing heat Gu, used for curing poison.\n\nClose to them, there was also the charred thunder potato mother Gu and a rice bag Gu.\n\nOn the surface of the sea, four flavor liquor worm played with the waves. Its fat body shone with red, blue, green and yellow, symbolizing spicy, bitter, sour and sweet; four flavors in total.\n\nIn the air, there was the canopy Gu and Yang Gu, playing around the snow silver waterfall.\n\nThe canopy Gu was like a giant ladybug, its half round white shell having black spots. The Yang Gu however gave off a warm white light.\n\nHis most important vital Gu, was still asleep, drawing the water from the river of time, to recover its body.\n\nOther than the Gu in his aperture, there was still the bone flesh unity Gu, as a bracelet on his arm, as it formed into a bracelet tattoo.\n\nIn his palm, there was the blood moon Gu.\n\nOn his tongue, there was the tusita flower tattoo.\n\nOn his left ear, the breath concealment Gu.\n\nOn his feet, the jumping grass Gu.\n\nFlesh-bone Gu was Bai Ning Bing’s, it had been returned to her. Originally, there was a plunder Gu that resembled a black beetle, Fang Yuan had used it to snatch the Gu worms in Bai Ning Bing’s aperture, but it had died from lack of food during the caravan journey.\n\nThese were all the Gu Fang Yuan possessed. 1\n\n“Heavenly essence treasure lotus has to be kept, but I do not have the recipe to continue refining it. I can still use it now, but when I reach rank four, its use will be negligible.”\n\n“Blood skull Gu is useless to me now, to nurture my descendants, there is too much trouble in terms of time and effort. Back then, first generation Gu Yue had no choice but to do it. I can change out this Gu, after all, it is one of the inheritance of the blood sea ancestor. I might be able to get a good Gu from the treasure realm. But treasure realm is the foundation of Shang clan, even if I had the purple thorn token… I have to plan this carefully.”\n\n“Spring Autumn Cicada, primeval elder Gu, and bone flesh unity Gu are definitely going to be kept, blood moon Gu is easy to raise but does not have enough attack and cannot be used as a set. Tusita flower should be changed too, there are better options available. I have to expose the breath concealment Gu, but jumping grass has to be removed. It was kept as emergency in the first place.”\n\n“Other than this, i have lots of strength Gu to buy, and also investigative, movement type Gu. Now that our situation is stable, and I have gained the trust of Shang clan, I can try to interact with the gambling den.”\n\nFang Yuan considered his options.\n\nThe Gu on him were all gathered individually, they could not form into a set. And they did not even cover all grounds, severely affecting his battle strength.\n\nAt Shang clan city, they finally had time to develop themselves. He has to use this opportunity, and race against time, to get his Gu worm set in two to three years. Creating his own battle style, as well as trying to raise his cultivation as high as possible.\n\nAfter that, the Three Kings Inheritance would start. Next would be the righteous demonic battle at Yi Tian mountain, one that affected the entire southern border. It was a grand event, where brave warriors reigned supreme. If one did not have enough strength, they would be cannon fodder. If he had the qualification to join, using Fang Yuan’s rebirth advantage, he would be able to gain great benefits.\n\n…\n\n“This subordinate greets Lord clan leader!” In the study room, Wei Yang kneeled.\n\nShang Yan Fei stopped writing, looking up: “Wei Yang, there is only the two of us here, do not be restrained.”\n\n“Thank you for the seat, clan leader.” Wei Yang sat at a nearby seat.\n\nShang Yan Fei laughed, as he recalled: “You, you are still so rigid. Remember when we first met, before you dominated the battle stage, back when I was still a Shang clan young master. So many years have passed already, it was all thanks to your assistance that I became clan leader.”\n\n“This subordinate does not dare to claim credit!” Wei Yang quickly stood up, cupping his fist: “I am but a boor, only able to assist in terms of fighting. Clan leader is both intelligent and strong, I am merely the icing on the cake.”\n\n“Hehehe. Although I am intelligent and strong, I am still one person. Only with all of you, can I establish a force strong enough to dominate. _Two fists cannot rival four palms_ , a good leader needs his men, am I right?” Shang Yan Fei looked at Wei Yang with deep intentions.\n\nWei Yang immediately realized that Shang Yan Fei had a deeper meaning, but could not understand his meaning, only cupping his fists: “This subordinate is ashamed.”\n\nShang Yan Fei changed the topic: “I had thought at first that Bai Ning Bing was a girl pretending to be a guy, after all, many clans carry a male leader mentality. But today, I heard from Doctor Su Shou, Bai Ning Bing asked her about the Yin Yang rotation Gu, it seems there is a hidden story behind this. But whether she is a guy or a girl, that is a small detail, it is no longer important. What is important, is whether she and that Fang Zheng would work for us Shang clan.”\n\nWei Yang was enlightened: “This subordinate understands.”\n\n“Mm, as long as you understand, you may leave.” Shang Yan Fei waved his hand.\n\n“This subordinate takes his leave.”\n\nSeeing the study room’s door close lightly, Shang Yan Fei leaned back on his chair and closed his eyes.\n\nFang and Bai were able to snatch the inheritance from Bai clan, and were able to escort Shang Xin Ci back, it showed that they had both brains and brawn.\n\nThey even had good aptitude, the report states they were rank three.\n\nThey were not even twenty yet, this truly was great talent!\n\nMost importantly, they knew how to repay kindness, this showed they had proper character, it made people feel at ease.\n\nAnd finally, they were not peasants, but were born as two clan’s successor, they had the symbol of righteousness ingrained in them from birth.\n\nShang Yan Fei had been in power for so many years, and had seen many young talents, but very few moved his heart like these two.\n\nBut the reason Shang Yan Fei wanted to recruit them, was not for himself, but for Shang Xin Ci.\n\nHe opened his eyes, and turned into a pillar of flame, disappearing from the study room.\n\nWhen he reappeared, he was at a huge walkway.\n\nAt the two sides of the walkway, there were tall stone pillars. The ground was paved with a type of white-silver colored brick. Shang Yan Fei stood beside the stone pillar, like an ant beside a pair of chopsticks.\n\nHe walked slowly in the empty walkway, only the echo of his walking could be heard.\n\nAfter a while, he arrived at the end of the walkway.\n\nA giant red door was in front of him.\n\nThe giant door was as tall as the walkway, over thirty meters tall. There was no handle on the door, instead there was the carving of a huge human face.\n\nThe face protruded out of the door, and was sound asleep. The details of the carving was simply perfection.\n\nShang Yan Fei came before the door, and stared at the red door, saying in an annoyed tone: “Living treasure door, stop pretending to be asleep, what’s the point? You’ve done this too many times.”\n\nThe face on the giant door immediately opened its eyes, staring at Shang Yan Fei, complaining: “Sigh, Little Fei Fei, you’ve grown up, you are not cute anymore!”\n\nAs it said so, it opened its huge mouth and a strong gust of wind blew, causing Shang Yan Fei’s hair to dance in the wind. Its voice was like thunder, as the echo reverberated in the walkway.\n\nShang Yan Fei’s eyes twitched: “Stop your nonsense, I am here to exchange for treasure.”"
