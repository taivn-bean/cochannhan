And Fang Yuan’s enslavement method was the best way to break the stalemate after all.\n\nFang Di Chang smiled: “What compensation do you want, friend? As long as you tell me, we will do our best to fulfill it.”\n\nFang Yuan asked for what compensation he would get, but Fang Di Chang flipped the question back at him.\n\nFang Yuan laughed: “Lord Fang is very straightforward, I am not greedy, I only want one rank seven Immortal Gu.”\n\nFang Yuan said this as he slowed down, his gaze flickered like he was embarrassed.\n\n“Rank seven Immortal Gu!” Fang Di Chang’s heart jumped, he got more angry but his expression became sincere looking as he smiled: “With your ability to suppress all the immemorial soul beasts, the contribution is enough for a rank seven Immortal Gu. If my clan can obtain Divine Bean Palace in the end, we will promise you another rank seven Immortal Gu!”\n\nFang Di Chang not only agreed to Fang Yuan’s request, he even added in more temptation.\n\n“I am ashamed.” Fang Yuan sighed deeply: “I need to get this rank seven Immortal Gu now, otherwise, I cannot make up my mind to pay that huge price and subdue the remaining immemorial soul beast.”\n\n“How can you be so impatient? You don’t trust my Fang clan?!” A Fang clan Gu Immortal could not control himself, he shouted loudly.\n\nFang Yuan cupped his fists: “Everyone, the price that I have to pay is too huge, my foundation will be heavily damaged. I can only make up my mind after getting the rank seven Immortal Gu!”\n\n“Fine, my Inquiry Dock has a method to communicate with the outside world, I will send over a rank seven Immortal Gu from our headquarters. This is our rank seven treasury, pick one.” Fang Di Chang said as an information path Gu worm flew out of his sleeve.\n\nIt was a rank seven information path Immortal Gu!\n\nIt was rare to see such Immortal Gu, Fang Yuan thought: “It is hard for me to acquire information, an information path Immortal Gu can help me gather information and find out many secrets. During rebirth, my past life’s memories were tampered by heaven’s will, there are traps in them, I cannot rely on these memories. During this period, I have been using Shadow Sect’s inheritance for information, but these things would become obsolete over time. This rank seven information path Immortal Gu is quite useful for me.”\n\nFang Yuan received the information path Immortal Gu and inspected it.\n\nThere were six rank seven Immortal Gu listed in it.\n\n“Fang clan has such deep foundations! They definitely have more than six rank seven Immortal Gu, Fang Di Chang just hid those that he did not want me to take.”\n\nJust these six Immortal Gu made Fang Yuan feel dazzled.\n\nHe was interested in each of these Immortal Gu, because he had Shadow Sect’s true inheritance, any Immortal Gu could be put to good use in his hands.\n\nBut soon, when Fang Yuan saw one of the Immortal Gu, his heart shook, he made up his mind and chose it!\n\n“Rank seven great thief Gu?” Fang Di Chang heard Fang Yuan’s choice and was quite surprised.\n\nThis was a theft path Immortal Gu, but Suan Bu Jin was a wisdom path Gu Immortal.\n\nFang Yuan did not explain, he did not need to. Fang Di Chang displayed these rank seven Immortal Gu, it meant that they were disposable to him. In the current situation, Fang clan was in a rush for time, not Fang Yuan, if they wanted to stall for time and not give him the Gu, Fang Yuan would just do nothing.\n\n“Or… is he afraid I will use this chance to stall him, so he purposely gave me a random answer? When I reject him, he will give it up immediately?” Fang Di Chang guessed, wisdom path Gu Immortals simply had too many thoughts in their minds.\n\n“Friend, you really want this Immortal Gu?” Fang Di Chang confirmed again.\n\nFang Yuan hesitated before answering: “Yes, this Gu.”\n\nFang Di Chang nodded: “Alright, I will accept this request.”\n\nSaying so, he used a killer move and retrieved this rank seven Immortal Gu from Fang clan’s headquarters, transporting it into Inquiry Dock.\n\nThe process was very fast, Fang Yuan soon obtained this great thief Gu, with Fang Di Chang’s help, he easily refined it.\n\nThis great thief Immortal Gu was like a beetle with a flat head and long horn, it was the size of an adult, its black exoskeleton had a metallic luster, giving off a tough feeling.\n\nFang Yuan obtained this Immortal Gu and felt secretly excited: “My gains are simply too great! I am a theft path great grandmaster now, I lack theft path Immortal Gu. To think that it would come to me now, this great thief Immortal Gu came at such great timing! Not only can it display my superiority in theft path, I can even start making use of ghostly concealment now!”\n\nFang Yuan had the theft path attainment level, it was very easy to create theft path immortal killer moves.\n\nAnd the most important one was ghostly concealment!\n\nThis immortal killer move was created by Thieving Heaven Demon Venerable himself, it was a rank nine killer move with incredible power. But all along, it had been relatively useless to Fang Yuan.\n\nWhy?\n\nEven though it could protect Fang Yuan from the detection of ghosts and soul beasts, whenever he tried to use an immortal killer move, he would be exposed.\n\nNobody could see a firecracker buried underground, but when it is ignited and explodes, people would sense it.\n\nFurthermore, ghostly concealment had been interfering with ghost soldier garment, weakening it and limiting its effect.\n\nGhostly concealment did not expend immortal essence, it operated on its own, that was the ability of a theft path supreme grandmaster. Only supreme grandmasters could surpass the limits and restrictions of this world to a certain extent.\n\nFang Yuan was a theft path great grandmaster, but he could not activate ghostly concealment himself. Even though he had a deeper understanding of it now, he still had many questions.\n\nBut these questions could not stop him from making use of the active ghostly concealment!\n\nAs for the way to use ghostly concealment, this rank seven great thief Immortal Gu was the key to solving the problem.\n\n“As long as I add in some mortal Gu and spend some time, I will be able to draw out and use a portion of ghostly concealment’s power!”\n\nBright light flashed across Fang Yuan’s eyes.\n\n“But now, I need to get rid of the immemorial soul beasts, Fang clan’s patience is dwindling.” Fang Yuan wanted to establish a relationship with Fang clan in order to develop in green ghost desert, he did not want to become enemies with them.\n\nThus, within the sovereign immortal aperture, he killed the two immemorial soul beasts that he had just subdued!\n\nThese two immemorial soul beasts were hard to kill, but Fang Yuan had control over them, not only would they not resist him, they would cooperate with him in their suicide.\n\nAfter dying, Fang Yuan obtained two huge soul cores.\n\nRank eight immortal materials, immemorial soul cores!\n\nThis was very rare.\n\nIf he was not in this situation, Fang Yuan would not have killed the two immemorial soul beasts. But there was no choice, hundred and eighty slaves relied on a huge number of soul beasts to work.\n\nFang Yuan had a vast number of soul beasts, including desolate beasts and ancient desolate beasts, but they could only help Fang Yuan control two immemorial desolate beasts, that was the limit!\n\nNow that Fang Yuan wanted to control more immemorial soul beasts, it was impossible.\n\nHe had no choice but to kill these two immemorial soul beasts!\n\nThis was the ‘huge price’ that Fang Yuan had mentioned to Fang Di Chang.\n\nHe was not lying, it was the truth, killing two rank eight battle strength existences, was it not a huge price?\n\nHowever, after doing this, Fang Yuan used attitude Gu and made himself shake as his face turned pale, blood started flowing out of his mouth and nose.\n\n“It seems that Suan Bu Jin was not lying, the method has a huge price to pay.” At once, the Fang clan Gu Immortals who saw this felt better psychologically.\n\n“Even though this is not good, the situation is very urgent, friend, I hope you can do your best.” Fang Di Chang urged.\n\n“Of course I will do my best!” Fang Yuan shouted, seemingly gathering his focus as he used hundred and eighty slaves on the flowery wind warriors again.\n\nAfter three tries, Fang Yuan succeeded in subduing the bull body leopard tail immemorial soul beast like what he did before.\n\nGuh.\n\nFang Yuan opened his mouth and spit out a mouthful of blood, his body could not stand firm, his face was pale as paper, devoid of any color, he almost fainted on the spot.\n\n“Suan Bu Jin, be careful!”\n\n“Mind your health, we still need your help for the final immemorial soul beast.”\n\n“How are your injuries? I can heal you!”\n\nFang clan’s immortals spoke one after another.\n\n“Don’t worry, don’t worry.” Fang Yuan waved his hand, there was nothing to be worried about, he was acting.\n\nFang clan’s Gu Immortals heard his words as their anger dissipated.\n\nNext, Fang Yuan tried again and subdued the final immemorial soul beast.\n\nThe truth was, he needed to thank flowery wind warriors. If not for its ability to store killer moves and use multiple of them at once, how could Fang Yuan obtain the immemorial soul beasts?"
